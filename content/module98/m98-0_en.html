	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>The Government of Canada publishes, on the Internet, yearly statistics on purchases and contracts conducted by federal departments and agencies. The objective of the annual Purchasing Activity Report is to provide a snapshot of the Government of Canada’s purchasing activities, based on the government’s policy framework.</p>

<p>All departments and agencies awarding contracts and amendments to contracts must report annually on all their contracting activities to the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. These reports must provide the total number of contracts awarded and the dollar amounts by categories of goods, services, and construction contracts (as defined in the Government Contracts Regulations), including amendments awarded within a department's own departmental authorities. They must also contain all contracting in respect of all trade agreements to which Canada is a signatory as well as any contracting subject to the Agreement on Internal Trade for procurements which commenced before July 1st, 2017 and the Canadian Free Trade Agreement for procurements which commenced on or after July 1st, 2017.</p>

<p>Individual department and agency results are collated and posted on the&nbsp;<abbr>TBS</abbr>&nbsp;website each year. By publishing this annual Purchasing Activity Report,&nbsp;<abbr>TBS</abbr>&nbsp;facilitates review by Parliament, builds the confidence of Canadians, and enhances transparency in government.</p>
