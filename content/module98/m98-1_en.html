	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>To support transparency and oversight of public resources, the Government of Canada has committed to the disclosure of contracting data via a centralized, machine-readable database available to the public. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14676" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a>, which support the Treasury Board Contracting Policy as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Access to Information Act">Access to Information Act</a>, require departments and agencies to publish on the&nbsp;<a href="https://open.canada.ca/en" rel="external" target="_blank" title=" Open Government Portal">Open Government Portal</a>&nbsp;reports on contracts and amendments above and below $10,000. This process has replaced the Purchasing Activity Report since 2017.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Reporting is to occur for:</p>

<ol>
	<li>contracting activities over $10,000 on a quarterly basis on the Open Government Portal;</li>
	<li>contracting activities below $10,000 on a yearly basis to the Treasury Board Secretariat and Public Services and Procurement Canada;</li>
	<li>aggregate data of contracting activities below $10,000 on a yearly basis on the Open Government Portal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reports collect a variety of data such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>contract date</li>
	<li>vendor name</li>
	<li>description of work</li>
	<li>total contract value</li>
	<li>commodity type</li>
	<li>solicitation procedure</li>
	<li>identification of contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension under the PSSA</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=14676" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a>&nbsp;provide guidance to managers and contracting officers on the identification, collection, reporting and publication of contract information that is to be proactively disclosed.</p>

<p>This measure ensures contracting activities can withstand public scrutiny and demonstrate sound stewardship of public funds, value for money, and adherence to values and ethics.</p>
