								<p>The Department of Justice Canada is responsible for the legal affairs of the government as a whole and for providing legal services to individual departments and agencies. These services include legal advice, preparing legal documents, drafting legislation, regulating or conducting litigation, and overseeing all legal mechanisms used to achieve the government’s overall objectives.</p>
								<p>The Government Contracts Regulations require that contracts for the performance of legal services may be entered into only by or under the authority of the Minister of Justice. Accordingly, while it is recognized that lawyers may be engaged for purposes other than the performance of legal services, the Department of Justice must be consulted in every case where a contract for services is entered into with a practising member of the bar, to determine whether the contract is for legal services and thus whether the approval of the Department of Justice is required. No contracting authority may enter into a contract for services with a practising member of the bar without first having obtained the Department of Justice’s approval, or having been advised by the Department of Justice that the contract does not involve legal services.</p>
