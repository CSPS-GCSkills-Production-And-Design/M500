										<p><strong>The answer is:</strong>&nbsp; Shared Services Canada Act.</p>
										<p>Ministers have the power to enter into service contracts under their own authorities. This is called the inherent power to contract and comes from the department establishing act; in this case, the Shared Services Canada Act. However, it is important to note that no matter the source of the authority, ministers cannot enter into or amend contracts that exceed the limits contained in the Treasury Board Contracts Directive&nbsp;–&nbsp;Appendix&nbsp;C of the&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;Contracting Policy. The contracting limits set out in the Treasury Board Contracts Directive will be explained in greater detail in the upcoming pages.</p>

				<p>Contracting for services can often be one of the most difficult types of contracting. It is unlike any other form of contracting, requiring special attention to particulars that do not exist when contracting for goods.</p>
				<p>The often-intangible nature of services creates challenges for the contracting officer and the client in terms of their ability to adequately define the requirement, develop meaningful evaluation criteria, determine a bidder's capabilities, and clearly articulate the respective responsibilities of the parties to the contract.</p>
				<p>Not only is contracting for services complex, the operating environment in the federal government today is both complex and subject to increasing scrutiny. Canadians have high expectations: among other things, they want government contracting to be transparent and they want assurances that they are receiving value for their tax dollars. Suppliers want their fair share of government business and are increasingly turning to the courts and other avenues (such as Canadian International Trade Tribunal [<abbr>CITT</abbr>], Competition Bureau or Office of the Procurement Ombudsman [<abbr>OPO</abbr>]) for redress if they think they have been unfairly treated.</p>
				<p>For these reasons, it is important that contracting officers and other public servants clearly understand what authority has been sub-delegated to them and to work within their authority.</p>
