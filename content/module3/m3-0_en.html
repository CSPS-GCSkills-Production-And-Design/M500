				<p>The procurement process in the federal government is more decentralized than ever before. While departments and agencies purchase many of their required goods and services using&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;standing offers and supply arrangements, they also award contracts under their own authority. They use their delegations of authority for contracting, to buy most of their own services, and lower dollar value goods.</p>
				<p>Where do they get their delegations of authority to approve and sign procurement contracts?</p>
				<p>At the end of this learning module, you will be able to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Describe the expenditure process and distinguish among the levels of delegation of authority required at each step of the process</li>
					<li>Define the roles and responsibilities of ministers in the area of delegation of authority</li>
					<li>Recognize the differences between delegations of authority for contracting for services compared to goods</li>
