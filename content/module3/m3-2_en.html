				<p>Let’s take a closer look at “transaction authority” or the authority to enter into contracts. As identified in each department’s establishing act (the Act that legally establishes or constitutes a department), ministers have inherent power to contract for goods and services.</p>
				<p>Although ministers responsible for departments have the inherent power to contract for goods and services, the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (<abbr title="Department of Public Works and Government Services Act">DPWGSA</abbr>) supplants the authority of each minister to contract for goods. That authority, however, is restored to the extent determined by the Minister of&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;through a formal delegation.</p>
				<p>Since 2007, the Minister of&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;has provided:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A standard $25,000 delegation of authority for the procurement of goods to colleague ministers responsible for other departments; and</li>
					<li>A higher delegation of authority for the procurement of goods when departments use&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;standing offers or supply arrangements and when goods are required as a result of a pressing emergency.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A “pressing emergency” is defined as being an actual or imminent life-threatening situation, a disaster which endangers the quality of life or has resulted in the loss of life, or one that may result in significant loss or damage to Crown property. In addition, emergency contracting is always limited to the most senior delegated official available in the department.</p>
				<p>Here is an example of a&nbsp;<a class="external" href="content/medias/documents/PSPC_standard_letter/index_en.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;standard letter of delegation of authorityThis link will open in a new window</a>&nbsp;for goods.</p>
				<p>As specified in the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="content/medias/documents/PSPC_standard_letter/index_en.html" target="_blank"><abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;standard letter of delegation of authorityThis link will open in a new window</a>, the following levels of delegation of authority may occur where departments (other than&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>) contract for goods:</p>
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>the amount of the contract including amendments does not exceed $25,000 (standard delegation of authority);</li>
					<li>the amount of the contract exceeds $25,000 but it is a call-up on a standing offer (standing offer);</li>
					<li>the amount of the contract exceeds $25,000 but under exceptional circumstances (special delegation of authority).</li>

								<h2><strong>Special Delegation</strong></h2>
								<p>Special delegation of authority for the procurement of specific goods from the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada to a colleague minister.</p>
								<p>Example: Using a special delegation of authority from the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr>, Transport Canada purchases a 2015 Lexus IS250 for $39,000 from a local dealership (off the lot) for vehicle testing purposes at the Transport Canada vehicle testing centre in Blainville, Quebec. Normally, government vehicles are purchased by <abbr>PSPC</abbr> on behalf of client departments by issuing call-ups against <abbr>PSPC</abbr> standing offers put in place directly with car manufacturers. In this case, however, Transport Canada had received a special delegation from the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> to purchase vehicles—strictly for testing purposes—directly off the lots and not from manufacturers through <abbr>PSPC</abbr> standing offers. These test vehicles are purchased from dealerships, rather than directly from manufacturers, to make sure they’re not specially “prepped” and are the same as a consumer would get.</p>
