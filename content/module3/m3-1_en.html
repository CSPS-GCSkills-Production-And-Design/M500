<p>Each minister in the federal government is responsible for resource management within his/her department. However, it is impossible for one person to assume full management of an entire department. Ministers therefore appoint subordinates to exercise specific powers for which they will be accountable. This is commonly known as “delegation of authority,” as defined in the Financial Administration Act under sections&nbsp;32, 33, and&nbsp;34.</p>

<p>Delegation of authority ensures the sound governance of public resources, notably with respect to fiscal management.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, managers are responsible for initiating and approving expenditures. They must have been granted the necessary authority to do so, and must respect the limits within which they are authorized to approve these expenditures or contracts.</p>

<p>Some key rules govern the authority to sign financial documents:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minister (and the deputy minister) must delegate in writing</li>
	<li>Authority is delegated to a position</li>
	<li>The supervisor must appoint a person to exercise the delegated authority</li>
	<li>An individual who has been delegated signing authority may not delegate it to another individual</li>
	<li>An individual should not exercise more than one of the following authorities for the same transaction: transaction authority (or the authority to enter into contracts), certification authority and payment authority</li>
	<li>And finally, an individual may not authorize a transaction from which he or she might benefit</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the expenditure process. There may be as many as six steps to ensure the proper governance of authority and accountability.</p>

<p>The process starts with a request for goods or services.</p>

<p>The <strong>first step</strong> is the authority to incur expenditures; for example, when a manager approves a training plan.</p>

<p><strong>Step&nbsp;2</strong> is the authority to carry out one or more specific functions related to the control of financial commitments. In other words, making sure that funding will be available to pay an account when it's due, before approving the transaction under section&nbsp;32.</p>

<p>The <strong>third step</strong> is the authority to enter into contracts, including purchasing with an acquisition card.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> is the receipt of goods or services.</p>

<p>Then it must be certified that the work has been performed as required, services and supplies have been satisfactorily provided, and the payment complies with policy requirements.</p>

<p>This certification authority represents <strong>Step 5</strong> and is referred to as “Section&nbsp;34.”</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>sixth step</strong> is the authority to pay, pursuant to section&nbsp;33. This function is usually performed by a financial officer after reviewing the legality of payments and exercising all appropriate financial controls.</p>

<p>All these steps aim to provide government with the assurance that expenditures are carried out in a responsible manner and that each stakeholder is accountable for his or her actions.</p>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-6"><p>Ministers and deputy heads sub‑delegate their authorities, in whole or in part, to assistant deputy ministers, directors general, directors, cost centre managers, and other officials as required. The exact positions or levels to whom delegation of authority is granted, the dollar limits, and the area of authority of each are specified in the department’s Delegation of Spending and Financial Signing Authorities Chart. Note that the look, format, and contents of a chart can vary from department to department.</p>

<p>Here’s a sample of a&nbsp;<a href="http://skynet-01.csps-efpc.com/aseguin/courses/M500_old/content/medias/documents/Delegation_Chart/index_en.html" target="_blank">Delegation of Spending and Financial Signing Authorities Chart</a>. Please note that this partial delegation of authorities chart for a fictitious department has been developed strictly for the purposes of this lesson. It does not necessarily contain all of the elements and information that would normally be included in a complete or actual chart. Consult your departmental delegation of authorities chart and related documentation in order to obtain the complete and exact delegation information for your department.</p>

<p>This sample chart distinguishes the various departmental levels and their financial and transaction authorities. Contracting officers and other public servants with delegation of authority to contract for goods and services are responsible for doing so up to the specified dollar value sub‑delegated to them. Notice the various types and levels of authorities that can be sub‑delegated. Contracting officers and other public servants are responsible for ensuring that they clearly understand what authority has been sub‑delegated to them and that they work within their authority.</p>

<p>Whether contracting for goods, services or construction services, the established thresholds must not be exceeded.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the source of the authority to contract for goods and services, how it is sub‑delegated within departments, and how it must be exercised.</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>The diagram illustrates the inherent power ministers have in regards to contracting for goods and services as identified in each Department’s establishing act.</p>

<p>Hereunder are two streams: Authority to enter into contracts for services and Authority to enter into contracts for goods.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The <strong>Authority to enter into contracts for services</strong> is delegated to ministers through their organization’s enabling legislations and then sub‑delegated to departmental officials through the organizational delegation instrument and up to the Treasury Board <a href="#">Contracting Limits</a>.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Authority to enter into contracts for goods</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The authority given to the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> in <a href="#">section&nbsp;9 of the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a> supplants the authority of each minister to contract for goods. The authority is restored to the extent determined by the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> through a delegation, in accordance with <a href="#">section&nbsp;8 of the Act</a>.</p>

<p>Using a Delegation of Authority letter, the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> then delegates this authority to ministers to procure goods for their respective organizations according to specific delegated amount. Through their organizational delegation instruments, the authority to contract for goods is then sub‑delegated to their departmental officials.</p>
