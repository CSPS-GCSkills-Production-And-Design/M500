				<p>Procurement is the function of obtaining goods and services, and carrying out construction and leasing through contracts and contractual arrangements. As public servants, we serve Canadians by exercising the procurement functions required to achieve our government's objectives.</p>

				<p>When acquiring goods or services or construction services, public servants must take many things into consideration. This course addresses the basic concepts and responsibilities related to government procurement projects. Participants will learn about the key elements underpinning the policies and practices of procurement in the federal government.</p>
