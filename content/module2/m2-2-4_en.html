				<p>The media play a critical role in increasing the scrutiny of government activities and, as a result, in strengthening accountability. This increased media scrutiny is facilitated in large part by the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Access to Information Act">Access to Information Act</a>, which permits Canadians and, in particular, the media to obtain information on the activities and actions of government, contributing to heightened public awareness of government activities and the decisions it makes.</p>

In 2014, the Conservative government paid $35&nbsp;million to settle a lawsuit over the handling of bids for a 2004 relocation services deal that an Ontario Superior Court judge assailed as “shocking” and rigged by bureaucrats to favour the winning bidder.</p>

							<p>The Replacement of Canada’s Fighter Jets project. The government announced its decision to buy the F‑35 fighter jets in July&nbsp;2010, and indicated that the acquisition costs for the F‑35s would be $9&nbsp;billion for a 20‑year lifespan. But in reality, the costs have risen steadily over a longer lifespan. As of today, no contracts have been issued for the purchase of these fighter jets.</p>

							<p>The Gomery Commission. The Commission of Inquiry into what became known as the sponsorship scandal was set up after the Auditor General of Canada expressed concerns about the management of a federal government sponsorship program in a 2003 report. Led by Justice John Gomery, the Commission’s investigation concluded that public service officials—with undue political involvement—awarded $2 million in contracts without a proper bidding system, added $250,000 to one contract price for no additional work and awarded $1.5 million for work that was never done, of which only $1.14 million was repaid. In its final report, the Commission recommended that its findings be addressed with a number of measures to increase accountability in government.</p>
