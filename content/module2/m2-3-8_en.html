	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>An internal audit is a professional, independent appraisal function that provides feedback on government management practices and activities, at both the departmental/agency and horizontal levels. The function assists in promoting the overall effectiveness and efficiency of government operations and the transparency of decision making.</p>

<p>Internal audits provide deputy heads with assurance as to the design and operation of the governance, risk management, and control processes in their organizations. This assurance function is an important part of the government's efforts to provide value and accountability to Canadians for their tax dollars.</p>

<p>Contributing to the government’s efforts, the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-3" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Financial Administration Act (FAA)">Financial Administration Act</a>&nbsp;requires that deputy heads of large departments establish an independent Departmental Audit Committee (<abbr>DAC</abbr>) that includes a majority of external members who have been recruited from outside the federal public administration.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr>DAC</abbr>’s role is to provide objective advice and recommendations to the deputy head regarding the sufficiency, quality and results of assurance on the adequacy and functioning of the department’s risk management, control and governance frameworks and processes (including accountability and auditing systems) and review all core areas (e.g.&nbsp;values and ethics, financial statements and Public Accounts of Canada reporting, risk management, follow‑up on management action plans, etc.) of departmental management, control and accountability processes, including reporting by using a risk-based approach. The independent members of the audit committee shall submit an annual report to the deputy head.</p>
