	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Given the volume and complexity of contracts awarded and administered by the federal government, it is inevitable that issues or complaints should arise.</p>

<p>Normally, when an issue or complaint is raised by a supplier or potential supplier, the contracting officer in the relevant department or agency is contacted to discuss the concern. Some departments have also established their own internal dispute-resolution processes. If the complaint cannot be resolved by the department or agency, the supplier or potential supplier can contact one of the procurement-complaint bodies listed below. Which body has the jurisdiction will depend on the nature of the issue in question, among other factors, including the dollar value of the contract.</p>

The Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the following acts. To learn more about each one, consult the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/h_00148.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Our Legislation">Competition Bureau’s website</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Competition Act</li>
	<li>Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act</li>
	<li>Textile Labelling Act</li>
	<li>Precious Metals Marking Act</li>
</ul>

<p>Complaints examined by the Competition Bureau must fall within the scope of these acts.</p>

<p>The basic operating assumption of the Competition Bureau is that competition is good for both business and consumers.</p>

<p>Price fixing, bid rigging, misleading representations, abuse of dominant position, mergers, etc., —these are all types of anti-competitive activities investigated by the Bureau.</p>

<p>On occasion, a potential supplier may file a complaint concerning a procurement action to the&nbsp;<abbr>CITT</abbr>, on the grounds that any aspect of the procurement process relating to a requirement covered by these agreements is unfair or discriminatory. For example, a supplier may have reason to believe that a contract has been or is about to be awarded improperly or illegally, or that in some way they have been wrongfully denied a contract or an opportunity to compete for one.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<abbr>CITT</abbr>&nbsp;is authorized to receive complaints pertaining to any aspect of the procurement process up to and including the awarding of the contract, and also to conduct inquiries and make determinations.</p>

<p>When the tribunal determines that a complaint is valid, it may recommend to the government such remedy as it considers appropriate, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>That a new solicitation for the designated contract be issued;</li>
	<li>That the bids be re‑evaluated;</li>
	<li>That the designated contract be terminated;</li>
	<li>That the designated contract be awarded to the complainant; or</li>
	<li>That the complainant be compensated for lost profits or loss of an amount specified by the tribunal.</li>
</ul>

<p>The impact of the&nbsp;<abbr>CITT</abbr>&nbsp;on the government procurement process has been to enforce rigid rules ensuring a fair, competitive, and transparent procurement process.</p>

<p>The following provides detailed information about these services.</p>

<p>The Procurement Ombudsman reports to the Minister of&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;and is mandated to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review complaints with respect to the awarding of a contract for the acquisition of goods below $26,400 and services below $105,700 (including taxes);</li>
	<li>Review complaints with respect to the administration of a contract, regardless of dollar value;</li>
	<li>Review the practices of departments for acquiring goods and services and make recommendations where necessary to improve those practices;</li>
	<li>Ensure that an alternative dispute-resolution process is provided, if both parties agree to participate;</li>
	<li>Provide an alternative dispute-resolution service that:
	<ul>
		<li>helps the parties to the contract understand each other’s views;</li>
		<li>focuses on resolving the dispute in a quick, positive and respectful manner;</li>
		<li>costs less and is less time-consuming than court proceedings;</li>
		<li>allows the parties full control over outcomes (no decision is “imposed”); and</li>
		<li>leads to a mutual agreement on a legally binding settlement.</li>
