				<p>As mentioned earlier, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada conducts a number of audits of government activities and expenditures every year. The results are published in the Auditor General’s Reports (normally released twice yearly) in the form of chapters and tabled in the House of Commons. In addition to providing the results of audits, the reports also contain follow-up reports which review the actions taken by departments in response to previous audits.</p>
				<p>After being tabled in Parliament, the Auditor General’s reports are referred to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for further examination.</p>
				<p>The Auditor General’s reports, and the subsequent dialogue they generate in Parliament, in the media, and among Canadians, are a good example of how public officials are increasingly being held to account. In addition, the findings and recommendations of the Auditor General serve to initiate or strengthen dialogue on subjects of interest to parliamentarians and Canadians, thus demonstrating that accountability serves many useful purposes.</p>
