	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>To support transparency and oversight of public resources, the Government of Canada has committed to the disclosure of contracting data via a centralized, machine-readable database available to the public. The&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-25">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a>, which support the Treasury Board Contracting Policy as well as the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-12"><em>Access to Information Act</em></a>, require departments and agencies to publish on the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-156">Open Government Portal</a>&nbsp;reports on contracts and amendments above and below $10,000. This process has replaced the Purchasing Activity Report since 2017.</p>

<p>Reporting is to occur for:</p>

<ol>
	<li>contracting activities over $10,000 on a quarterly basis on the Open Government Portal;</li>
	<li>contracting activities below $10,000 on a yearly basis to the Treasury Board Secretariat and Public Services and Procurement Canada;</li>
	<li>aggregate data of contracting activities below $10,000 on a yearly basis on the Open Government Portal.</li>
</ol>

	<!-- This element is a plain Text area -->
	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-3"><p>Reports collect a variety of data such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>contract date</li>
	<li>vendor name</li>
	<li>description of work</li>
	<li>total contract value</li>
	<li>commodity type</li>
	<li>solicitation procedure</li>
	<li>identification of contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension under the PSSA</li>
</ul>

<p>The TB <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-25" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a> provide guidance to managers and contracting officers on the identification, collection, reporting and publication of contract information that is to be proactively disclosed.</p>

<p>This measure ensures contracting activities can withstand public scrutiny and demonstrate sound stewardship of public funds, value for money, and adherence to values and ethics.</p>
