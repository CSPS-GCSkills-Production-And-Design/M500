	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>The procurement process is complex and so is the framework that governs it, which has many components. This is why contracting officers must understand their responsibilities and their accountabilities and the scrutiny they are under as stewards of public funds. They must ensure the integrity of the procurement process at all times. If there is any doubt that what is being done (or requested by the client) might bring the integrity of the process into question, the contracting officer should consider suspending the procurement process until the issue is resolved. Issues that cannot be resolved satisfactorily by the contracting officer must be referred to a higher authority within the department or agency.</p>

	A contracting officer is riding a unicycle on a tightrope between two pillars representing (1) Client Demands and (2) Canadians/Industry Interests.
	The contracting officer is juggling multiple aspects of procurement: Accessibility Considerations, Aboriginal Considerations, Employment Equity, Official Languages, Questions/Unknowns, Trade Agreements, Openness/Fairness/Transparency, Risks, Urgencies, Sourcing Methods, Product Costs, Socio-economic Benefits, Security Requirements, Modern Treaties/Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements, and Environmental Considerations.
	Under the tightrope are the complaint bodies: Media, Office of the Procurement Ombudsman, Canadian International Trade Tribunal, Competition Bureau and Auditor General.
