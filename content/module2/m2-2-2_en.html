			<p>The Auditor General of Canada is an Officer of Parliament who carries out work on behalf of Parliament and who is accountable to Parliament.</p>
			<p>The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) serves Parliament by providing it with objective, fact-based information and expert advice on government programs and activities, gathered through audits. Parliamentarians use OAG reports to oversee government activities and hold the federal government to account for its handling of public funds.</p>
			<p>The OAG audits a vast range of activities conducted by the Canadian federal government and the three territories (Nunavut, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories). These activities cover topics such as procurement, health, culture, the environment, finance, agriculture, transportation, and scientific research, to name only a few.</p>
			<p>Regarding <strong>procurement activities</strong>, the objectives of an audit are to ensure that an adequate management-control framework is in place to effectively support contracting and procurement activities, and that contracting and procurement activities are processed in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies, directives, and procedures. Such a framework will help management to receive reliable and relevant information on contracting to support informed decision-making, risk management, and effective disclosure. Also, having governance structures in place makes it possible to review and act upon contracting trends and risks.</p>

			<p>The Commissioner of Lobbying is an independent Officer of Parliament, appointed by both houses of Parliament for a term of seven years.

				<li>The use of lobbyists by a prospective contractor is not prohibited. However, contractors who do business with the government must not retain lobbyists whom they pay on a contingency basis.

				<li>The restriction on the use of lobbyists applies only to contracts where lobbyists are or may be expected to be used.

				<li>In circumstances where organizations contract with lobbyists to assist them in seeking grants or contributions from federal government entities, fees paid to lobbyists should not be related to the value of any grant or contribution.

				<li>All contracting authorities must include in all applicable contracts a lobbyist certification clause to prohibit suppliers from engaging lobbyists on a contingency fee basis to help them obtain contracts.

			<p>The Office of the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner investigates wrongdoing in the federal public sector and helps protect from reprisal whistleblowers and those who participate in investigations.</p>

In that role, the Commissioner conducts audits to determine how federal institutions are responding to their obligations under the Act, and regularly reports to Parliament on how well they are meeting their language obligations. In addition, the Commissioner has the authority to conduct investigations on complaints from the public and takes action further to these complaints, if applicable.</p>
			<p>The Act has specific implications for the <strong>procurement function</strong>. For example, any contract for the provision of services where the government department itself would be required to provide services in either official language must include a requirement for the contractor to provide the services in either official language. In addition, suppliers must be dealt with in the official language of their choice, and should have access to information related to the procurement process in the official language of their choice.</p>
			<p>When bid solicitations are national in scope or originate from an office having the obligation to serve the public in both official languages (refer to the <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-17" target="_blank" rel="external" title="List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes" aria-aspopup="true" data-ext="ext-wb-17" class="external">List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes</a> ), <strong>all regular or standardized documents</strong> must be provided in both official languages (whether through the media or by electronic communications systems).&nbsp; This requirement also applies to public notices such as Notices of Proposed Procurement, terms and conditions, basic forms, bid solicitations, standards,  purchase descriptions, and contracts.</p>
			<p>Where <strong>non‑standardized documents</strong>, such as specifications, are used, the federal institution initiating the requirement is responsible for determining if these documents must be available in both official languages. Such documents may be provided in only one official language when the institution determines and can substantiate, based on relevant information regarding their public and the marketplace, that they will be requested in that language only. </p>
			<p>When the bidding is not national in scope or when an office of a federal institution does not have obligations under the Act and Regulations, the contracting documents may be prepared only in the official language of the majority of the population concerned. This also applies to subsequent operations.</p>

For example, any contract for the provision of services where the government department itself would be required to provide services in either official language must include a requirement for the contractor to provide the services in either official language. In addition, suppliers must be dealt with in the official language of their choice, and should have access to information related to the procurement process in the official language of their choice.</p>
			<p>When bid solicitations are national in scope or originate from an office having the obligation to serve the public in both official languages (refer to the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-17">List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes</a> ), <strong>all regular or standardized documents</strong> must be provided in both official languages (whether through the media or by electronic communications systems).&nbsp; This requirement also applies to public notices such as Notices of Proposed Procurement, terms and conditions, basic forms, bid solicitations, standards,  purchase descriptions, and contracts.</p>
			<p>Where <strong>non‑standardized documents</strong>, such as specifications, are used, the federal institution initiating the requirement is responsible for determining if these documents must be available in both official languages. Such documents may be provided in only one official language when the institution determines and can substantiate, based on relevant information regarding their public and the marketplace, that they will be requested in that language only. </p>
			<p>When the bidding is not national in scope or when an office of a federal institution does not have obligations under the Act and Regulations, the contracting documents may be prepared only in the official language of the majority of the population concerned. This also applies to subsequent operations.</p>
