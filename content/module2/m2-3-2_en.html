	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-2"><p>Deputy heads must report on service contracts with former public servants in receipt of a&nbsp;<abbr>PSSA</abbr>&nbsp;pension.</p>

<p>While the Treasury Board Contracting Policy defines former public servants in broad terms, the new measures (described below) apply only to service contracts formed with former public servants in receipt of a pension under the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-26" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Public Service Superannuation Act">Public Service Superannuation Act</a>&nbsp;(a&nbsp;<abbr>PSSA</abbr>&nbsp;pension). This includes an individual or an individual who has become incorporated or formed a sole proprietorship. It also includes partnerships of former public servants in receipt of&nbsp;<abbr>PSSA</abbr>&nbsp;pensions or entities in which the affected individual has a controlling or major interest in the entity. The measures do not apply to former members of the Canadian Forces or the&nbsp;<abbr>RCMP</abbr>&nbsp;(unless they are also in receipt of a&nbsp;<abbr>PSSA</abbr>&nbsp;pension), or to former public servants who are not in receipt of a pension.</p>

	<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-3"><p><strong>Quarterly reports:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Deputy heads are to provide their respective ministers with quarterly reports on all service contracts awarded to former public servants in receipt of a&nbsp;<abbr>PSSA</abbr>&nbsp;pension. These reports should include, at a minimum, the following information: contract number, name of the contractor, dollar value of the contract, the nature of the requirement, the procurement strategy (e.g.&nbsp;sole source or competitive) and the rationale for its awarding.</p>
