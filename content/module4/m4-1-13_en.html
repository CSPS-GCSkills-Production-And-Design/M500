										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes.&nbsp;<abbr title="Employee Assistance Program">EAP</abbr>&nbsp;contracts such as this one must specify that personal information collected for&nbsp;<abbr title="Employee Assistance Program">EAP</abbr>&nbsp;purposes is deemed to be under the control of the department and is consequently subject to the Privacy Act.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12510&amp;section=text" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Policy on Privacy Protection">Policy on Privacy Protection</a>&nbsp;states that heads of government institutions are responsible for establishing measures, when personal information is involved, to ensure that the government institution meets the requirements of the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Privacy Act">Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;when contracting with private-sector organizations, or when establishing agreements or arrangements with public-sector organizations.</p>
										<p>The purpose of the Privacy Act is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves (including medical information) held by a government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information.</p>
										<p>Contracting officers should review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/access-information-privacy/privacy/guidance-document-taking-privacy-into-account-before-making-contracting-decisions.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Guidance Document: Taking Privacy Into Account Before Making Contacting Decisions">Guidance Document: Taking Privacy into Account Before Making Contacting Decisions</a>&nbsp;whenever personal information about Canadians is to be handled or accessed by private-sector suppliers or agencies under contract. This guidance document will help contracting officers and program managers in two ways. It helps with deciding if an outsourcing contract (under which personal information may be handled) is appropriate or not; and if a decision is made to proceed with a contract, will provide guidance on clauses and wording that can be considered for requests for proposals (<abbr title="Requests for proposals">RFP</abbr>s), statements of work (<abbr title="Statements of work">SOW</abbr>s), and contracts, all of which are designed to mitigate privacy risks. This guidance document was developed in response to privacy risks associated with the potential exposure of Canadians' personal information to U.S. authorities under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/html/PLAW-107publ56.htm" rel="external" target="_blank" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>.</p>
										<p>This Act permits U.S. law enforcement officials to seek a court order allowing them to access the personal records of any individual for the purpose of an anti-terrorism investigation without informing individuals or agencies that such disclosure has occurred. In theory, as a result of government contracting activities, U.S. officials could access information about Canadians through U.S. firms or their affiliates, even if the data is located in Canada.</p>
