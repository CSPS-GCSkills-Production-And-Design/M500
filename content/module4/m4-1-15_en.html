                <p>The Department of National Defence has a requirement to purchase a fleet of 25&nbsp;tactical armoured patrol vehicles to give its troops a high degree of protection and mobility on the battlefield. The estimated cost of this major requirement is $34&nbsp;million plus $1&nbsp;million for in‑service support over a five-year period. Defence and specialized vehicle firms are aware that the Government of Canada will be awarding a contract for this requirement in the near future, and are therefore preparing to respond to this Government of Canada request.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, individuals, groups or companies have a right to communicate with elected or appointed government officials.</p>
                                        <p>Mr. Point is a consultant lobbyist—that is, a person who is hired to communicate with or arranges meetings with a public office holder, on behalf of a client. As a consultant lobbyist, Mr. Point has registered this lobbying undertaking less than ten days after entering into the activity (as required in the Act). In initial registrations, consultant lobbyists provide information about the positions that they have held within the Government of Canada before they started lobbying; which individuals, corporations, organizations or associations they represent (their clients); which parent and subsidiary companies benefit from their lobbying activities; the names and descriptions of the specific legislative proposals, bills, regulations, policies, programs of interest, grants, contributions and/or contracts sought; which Government of Canada departments or agencies are being contacted and the communication techniques being used; and whether or not the lobbyists expect to arrange meetings in the course of their undertakings.</p>
                                        <p>As a former assistant deputy minister, Mr. Point is a former designated public office holder. Former designated public office holders are prohibited from carrying on most lobbying activities for a period of five years after leaving office. Mr. Point has been retired for more than five years now.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-14" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Lobbying Act">Lobbying Act</a>&nbsp;is to ensure transparency and accountability in the lobbying of federal public office holders in order to contribute to increasing Canadians' confidence in the integrity of the government decision-making process.</p>
                                        <p>The Lobbying Act is based on four key principles:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Free and open access to government is an important matter of public interest;</li>
                                            <li>Lobbying public office holders is a legitimate activity;</li>
                                            <li>It is desirable that public office holders and the general public be able to know who is engaged in lobbying activities; and</li>
                                            <li>The system of registration of paid lobbyists should not impede free and open access to government.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-123" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct">Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;is based on the same four principles of the Act. Three overriding principles in the Code require lobbyists to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty; to be open and frank about their lobbying activities; and to observe the highest professional and ethical standards. Under the Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct, lobbyists are also required to follow rules regarding their conduct.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr>PSPC</abbr>) should be conducting the procurement process for this requirement.</p>
                                        <p>In this situation, there are two key considerations that lead to this conclusion:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-125" target="_blank"><em>Defence Production Act</em></a> (<abbr>DPA</abbr>) gives the Minister of PSPC the responsibility to administer the <abbr>DPA</abbr> and the <strong>exclusive authority</strong> to buy or otherwise acquire <a href="#glossary_defence_supplies" class="csps-glossary wb-lbx" > defence supplies</a> and construct defence projects required by the Department of National Defence (subject to exceptions listed at subsection&nbsp;10(2) of the <abbr>DPA</abbr>). All <abbr>PSPC</abbr> contracts for defence supplies or projects are governed by the provisions of the <abbr>DPA</abbr>.</li>
                                            <li>In the event that this requirement was not subject to <abbr>DPA</abbr>, <abbr>PSPC</abbr> would remain the contracting authority for this procurement as it has the delegated authorities as a common service provider. As per the basic contracting limits set out in <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-151" target="_blank">Appendix&nbsp;C of the TB Contracting Policy</a>, <abbr>PSPC</abbr> has up to $75 million for the procurement of goods and <abbr>DND</abbr> has the delegated authority to award competitive contracts for goods valued at $7.5 million.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Below is additional information on contracting limits - <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-151" target="_blank">Appendix&nbsp;C of the TB Contracting Policy</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The Treasury Board Contracts Directive establishes the financial limits above which Treasury Board (<abbr>TB</abbr>) approval is required to enter into or amend a contract.</p>
                                        <p>The contract entry and amending limits are determined by:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>the type of contract (i.e.&nbsp;goods, services, construction, or specialized services such as architectural and engineering services); and</li>
                                            <li>competitive vs. non-competitive contract.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The directive enumerates three types of contracting limits:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>basic contracting limits</li>
                                            <li>exceptional contracting limits</li>
                                            <li>emergency contracting limits</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Basic contracting limits are standard contracting limits that apply to all government departments and agencies listed in schedules&nbsp;I, I.1, and&nbsp;II of the <em>Financial Administration Act</em>, with some exceptions.</p>
                                        <p>Exceptional contracting limits are special contracting limits for certain commodities and departments.</p>
                                        <p>Emergency contracting limits provide all departments and agencies with authority to enter into and amend a contract with a total value of up to $1&nbsp;million (including amendments) in response to a pressing emergency. The <abbr>TB</abbr> Contracting Policy defines an emergency as &ldquo;a situation where delay in taking action would be injurious to the public interest.&rdquo; Additional emergency contracting limits have been granted to the Department of National Defence (<abbr>DND</abbr>) and Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr>PSPC</abbr>).</p>
