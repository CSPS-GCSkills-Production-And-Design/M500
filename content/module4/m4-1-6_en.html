				<p>As a contracting officier with the Department of National Defence, you are being asked for contracting advice regarding a major environmental clean‑up contract for a portion of&nbsp;<abbr>DND</abbr>&nbsp;occupied land in the Harvey Barracks and practice areas (former Canadian Forces Base Calgary). The environmental clean‑up is to be conducted in the northeast portion of the Tsuu T’ina First Nation territory located on the southwest city limits of Calgary, Alberta. The department is aware that there are a few firms in the Tsuu T’ina Nation that possess the required equipment and expertise to perform the type of environmental clean‑up required by the department.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>The other Aboriginal considerations to take into account is the <a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-66" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Booklet"> Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business</a>&nbsp;(<abbr>PSAB</abbr>).</p>
										<p>As explained in Module 2,&nbsp;<abbr>PSAB</abbr>&nbsp;consists of measures intended to increase the number of Aboriginal firms competing for and winning federal contracts. It includes measures to better inform Aboriginal businesses about government procurement needs and to better inform government contracting officers about the capacity of Aboriginal businesses.</p>
										<p>The strategy is consistent with the government’s general policy on procurement, which emphasizes competition and value for money. The federal government’s primary motivation in this policy lies in its commitment to create jobs and ensure economic growth in Aboriginal communities for the benefit of all Canadians.</p>
										<h3>Key points of the&nbsp;<abbr>PSAB</abbr>:</h3>
										<h4>Who is eligible?</h4>
										<p>Aboriginal businesses and joint ventures that satisfy Aboriginal ownership and Aboriginal employment requirements. These include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Aboriginal businesses which are 51% Aboriginal owned and controlled;</li>
											<li>An Aboriginal business with a full-time labour force of six or more employees having at least 33% Aboriginal representation; and</li>
											<li>Joint ventures of Aboriginal businesses and non‑Aboriginal businesses where the Aboriginal business has at least 51% ownership and control of the joint venture.</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>Main Components of Procurement Strategy</h4>
										<p>Primary components of the&nbsp;<abbr>PSAB</abbr>&nbsp;include “set asides” (mandatory and voluntary), supplier development activities, supplier information activities, sub contracting, and joint ventures, as previously explained in Module 2.</p>
										<p>A set aside is a procurement which has been taken out of the normal context and reserved for Aboriginal businesses—keeping in mind that they have the capacity for the job and that value can be obtained for the government.</p>
										<p>The decision to choose a&nbsp;<abbr>PSAB</abbr>&nbsp;set-aside procurement is the responsibility of each department, or in the case of&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;their clients. In addition, contracting officers are to inform Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) when a procurement is set aside under&nbsp;<abbr>PSAB</abbr>.</p>
										<h4>Trade Agreements</h4>
										<p>Procurements set aside under <abbr>PSAB</abbr> are not subject to the obligations of national and international trade agreements. This provides for a greater flexibility in the bidding period, whether or not a more traditional competitive approach is used or the electronic tendering method is favoured.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>All contracts entered into or amendments valued at $10,000 or more are to be publicly disclosed on the the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-112">Open Government Portal</a> on a quarterly basis.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-25" class="external" target="_blank" title="Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a>&nbsp;provide guidance to managers and contracting officers on the identification, collection, and publication of contract information that is to be proactively disclosed.</p>
										<p>The government commitment is to disclose contracts or amendments valued at over $10,000 with only very limited exceptions, such as national security. A department may withhold information regarding the following:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Memorandums of Understanding (<abbr>MOU</abbr>s) with other levels of government and foreign governments;</li>
											<li>Service-Level Agreements (<abbr>SLAs</abbr>) between federal departments and Crown corporations;</li>
											<li>Information about contracts whose proactive disclosure would compromise criminal investigations, national security or public safety;</li>
											<li>Information described in paragraphs 20(1)(a) to (d) of the Access to Information Act, (for example, a contractor’s confidential pricing information).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Although standing offers and supply arrangements are not contracts, they are to be disclosed for the purpose of transparency.</p>
										<p>For contracts with task authorizations, the full potential value of the contract may be disclosed upon awarding of the contract, unless the full value is not expected to be used. In the latter situation, each task authorization may be disclosed individually. When a contract includes a fixed deliverable and another deliverable that requires a task authorization, the department may disclose the contract and task authorizations in any manner that is transparent.</p>
										<p>To learn more about the publication and reporting of contracts, and monitoring of proactive disclosure, you can consult the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-25" class="external" target="_blank" title="Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts">Guidelines on the Proactive Disclosure of Contracts</a>.</p>
										<p>Under the&nbsp;<a  href="#" data-ext="ext-wb-12" class="external" target="_blank" title="Access to Information Act">Access to Information Act</a>&nbsp;, citizens can submit requests for government information, including information on contracts. The Access to Information Act extends Canada’s present laws to provide a right of access to information in records under the control of a federal government institution in accordance with the principles that: government information should be available to the public, necessary exceptions to the right of access should be limited and specific, and decisions on the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of government.</p>
										<p>Each department has an access to information and privacy coordinator who receives requests for departmental information and determines what, if any, information can be released to the public, according to the requirements of the Act.</p>
