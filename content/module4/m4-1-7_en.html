				<p>As a&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;contracting officer in the Vancouver regional office, you receive a requisition to put in place a professional service contract to undertake a detailed comprehensive inspection of 56&nbsp;bridges and five culverts under the jurisdiction of&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;on the Alaska Highway in the Province of British Columbia. After posting a Notice of Proposed Procurement (<abbr>NPP</abbr>) on the Government Electronic Tendering System (<abbr>GETS</abbr>), three bids are received and properly evaluated. Once the financial proposals are opened, the successful structural engineering firm with the necessary expertise, capacity and resources to meet the project objectives is identified and awarded a $978,000 contract for the execution of the work over a three-year period.</p>
