				<p>The Department of National Defence has a requirement to purchase a fleet of 25&nbsp;tactical armoured patrol vehicles to give its troops a high degree of protection and mobility on the battlefield. The estimated cost of this major requirement is $34&nbsp;million plus $1&nbsp;million for in‑service support over a five-year period. Defence and specialized vehicle firms are aware that the Government of Canada will be awarding a contract for this requirement in the near future, and are therefore preparing to respond to this Government of Canada request.</p>

									<p>The services of Mr.&nbsp;Paul Point, a former associate deputy minister with the Department of National Defence (retired in 2008), have been retained to act as a consultant lobbyist (registered) on behalf of Land Protect Inc. Mr.&nbsp;Point is looking to schedule meetings with the deputy minister of National Defence and other senior&nbsp;<abbr>DND</abbr>&nbsp;officials responsible for land vehicles. The objective of these meetings is to discuss and obtain more information on the upcoming requirement for the tactical armoured patrol vehicles and to promote Land Protect Inc.’s products and services, its solid reputation, and track record.

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, individuals, groups or companies have a right to communicate with elected or appointed government officials.</p>
										<p>Mr. Point is a consultant lobbyist—that is, a person who is hired to communicate with or arranges meetings with a public office holder, on behalf of a client. As a consultant lobbyist, Mr. Point has registered this lobbying undertaking less than ten days after entering into the undertaking (as required in the Act). In initial registrations, consultant lobbyists provide information about the positions that they have held within the Government of Canada before they started lobbying; which individuals, corporations, organizations or associations they represent (their clients); which parent and subsidiary companies benefit from their lobbying activities; the names and descriptions of the specific legislative proposals, bills, regulations, policies, programs of interest, grants, contributions and/or contracts sought; which Government of Canada departments or agencies are being contacted and the communication techniques being used; and whether or not the lobbyists expect to arrange meetings in the course of their undertakings.</p>
										<p>As a former assistant deputy minister, Mr. Point is a former designated public office holder. Former designated public office holders are prohibited from carrying on most lobbying activities for a period of five years after leaving office. Mr. Point has been retired for more than five years now.</p>
										<p>The purpose of the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-14" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Lobbying Act">Lobbying Act</a>&nbsp;is to ensure transparency and accountability in the lobbying of federal public office holders in order to contribute to increasing Canadians' confidence in the integrity of the government decision-making process.</p>
										<p>The Lobbying Act is based on four key principles:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Free and open access to government is an important matter of public interest;</li>
											<li>Lobbying public office holders is a legitimate activity;</li>
											<li>It is desirable that public office holders and the general public be able to know who is engaged in lobbying activities; and</li>
											<li>The system of registration of paid lobbyists should not impede free and open access to government.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-123" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct">Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;is based on the same four principles of the Act. Three overriding principles in the Code require lobbyists to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty; to be open and frank about their lobbying activities; and to observe the highest professional and ethical standards. Under the Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct, lobbyists are also required to follow rules regarding their conduct.</p>

										<p><strong>he answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr>PSPC</abbr>) should normally be conducting the procurement process for this requirement.</p>
										<p>Based on the limits specified in&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-159" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Treasury Board Contracts Directive">Appendix C of the TB Contracting Policy</a>, the Department/|Minister of National Defence does not have the delegation of authority to contract for this requirement (unless pre-authorized by Treasury Board).</p>
										<p>The Treasury Board Contracts Directive establishes the financial limits above which Treasury Board (<abbr>TB</abbr>) approval is required to enter into or amend a contract.</p>
										<p>The contract entry and amending limits are determined by:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The type of contract (i.e.&nbsp;goods, services, construction, or architectural and engineering services);</li>
											<li>Competitive vs. non-competitive contract; and</li>
											<li>Use of traditional vs. electronic bidding process for a competitive procurement.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The directive enumerates five types of contracting limits:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>basic contracting limits</li>
											<li>contracting limits for service contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension</li>
											<li>contracting limits for service contracts with former public servants in receipt of a lump sum payment</li>
											<li>exceptional contracting limits</li>
											<li>emergency contracting limits</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Basic contracting limits are standard contracting limits that apply to all government departments and agencies listed in schedules&nbsp;I, I.1, and&nbsp;II of the Financial Administration Act, with the exception of organizations such as the Canada Revenue Agency and Parks Canada, who through their enabling legislation are not subject to the Government Contracts Regulations, the Treasury Board Contracting Policy, or the Treasury Board Contracts Directive.</p>
										<p>Exceptional contracting limits are special contracting authorities that&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;has delegated to departments for specific purposes and under specific conditions.</p>
										<p>Emergency contracting limits provide all departments and agencies with authority to enter into and amend a contract with a total value of up to $1&nbsp;million (including amendments) in response to a pressing emergency. The&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;Contracting Policy defines an emergency as “a situation where delay in taking action would be injurious to the public interest.” Additional emergency contracting authorities have been granted to the Department of National Defence (<abbr>DND</abbr>) and Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr>PSPC</abbr>).</p>
										<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-125" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Defence Production Act">Defence Production Act</a>&nbsp;(<abbr>DPA</abbr>) gives the Minister of&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;the responsibility to administer the&nbsp;<abbr>DPA</abbr>&nbsp;and the exclusive authority to buy or otherwise acquire defence supplies and construct defence projects required by the Department of National Defence (subject to exceptions listed at subsection&nbsp;10(2) of the&nbsp;<abbr>DPA</abbr>). All&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;contracts for defence supplies or projects are governed by the provisions of the&nbsp;<abbr>DPA</abbr>.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<abbr>DPA</abbr>&nbsp;includes the following three parts: (1)&nbsp;Procurement of Defence Supplies; (2)&nbsp;Regulations of Access to Controlled Goods; and (3)&nbsp;Offence and Punishment.</p>
										<p>Part&nbsp;1 of the Act confers exceptional powers on the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada (formerly Public Works and Government Services Canada) related to the procurement, production and disposal of defence supplies and defence projects.</p>
										<p>Part&nbsp;2 deals with the regulation of access to controlled goods, including requirements for registration, offences and prohibitions. (Part&nbsp;3 defines offences, continuing offence and factors to consider when sentencing.)</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>In accordance with the Treasury Board&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-126" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Procurement Review Policy">Procurement Review Policy</a>&nbsp;, the requirement must be reviewed.</p>
										<p>The objective of the Procurement Review Policy is to enhance the use of procurement in support of national socio-economic objectives in a manner that is fully consistent with the government’s other objectives (e.g.&nbsp;the pre‑eminence of operational requirements, competition, fairness and accessibility, all within Canada’s international trade obligations).</p>
										<p>The policy states that all government procurements exceeding $2&nbsp;million must be reviewed for potential opportunities to support industrial and regional development and other national objectives (e.g.&nbsp;the environment, employment, and equity programs). The primary mechanism for selecting the review for socio-economic benefits is inclusion in the department's annual short-range acquisition plan.</p>
										<p>The review process is carried out by the interdepartmental Procurement Review Committee (<abbr>PRC</abbr>), which is responsible for providing linkages between the government’s national objectives and individual procurements. The&nbsp;<abbr>PRC</abbr>&nbsp;consists of a number of federal departments:&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;and/or requesting department, Industry Canada, the regional agencies/departments, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, National Research Council, Finance Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat. The&nbsp;<abbr>PRC</abbr>&nbsp;makes recommendations to the operating and contracting departments regarding appropriate procurement strategies and other initiatives that would support government objectives in individual acquisitions.</p>
										<p>A mandatory procurement review does not apply in the following situations:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Foreign aid by or on behalf of Global Affairs Canada;</li>
											<li>Procurements by the Canadian Commercial Corporation on behalf of entities not subject to this policy (e.g.&nbsp;foreign governments);</li>
											<li>The acquisition, modification and routine maintenance of real property; and</li>
											<li>Security requirements by or on behalf of the Communications Security Establishment of the Department of National Defence; the Canadian Security Intelligence Service; and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for the purpose of pursuing criminal investigations.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In cases of a pressing emergency, as defined in the Treasury Board Contracting Policy, departments may enter into contracts without submitting the strategy for procurement review pursuant to&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;Procurement Review Policy. Such action should be noted in any subsequent submission or report to&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;or TB Secretariat (if such a submission or report is required), and should also be reported to the PRC Secretariat within 60&nbsp;calendar days.</p>
										<p>This requirement is also subject to the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-157" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Website">Federal Contractors Program</a>&nbsp;(<abbr>FCP</abbr>). The&nbsp;<abbr>FCP</abbr>&nbsp;ensures that contractors who do business with the Government of Canada achieve and maintain a workforce that is representative of the Canadian workforce. The program applies to non-federally regulated contractors that:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>have a combined workforce in Canada of 100 or more permanent full-time and permanent part-time employees; and</li>
											<li>have received an initial federal government goods and services contract valued at $1 million or more (including applicable taxes).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The Federal Contractors Program was established in 1986 to further the goal of achieving workplace equity for designated groups experiencing discrimination in the Canadian labour market. These groups are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Women;</li>
											<li>Aboriginal Peoples;</li>
											<li>Persons with disabilities; and</li>
											<li>Members of visible minorities.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Contractors who bid on an initial goods and services contract, a standing offer, or a supply arrangement estimated at $1&nbsp;million or more (including applicable taxes) with the Government of Canada must first certify their commitment to implementing employment equity by signing the&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-154" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Agreement to Implement Employment Equity">Agreement to Implement Employment Equity</a>&nbsp;(<abbr>AIEE</abbr>) prior to the awarding of the contract.</p>
										<p>Once the goods and services contract, the standing offer, or the supply arrangement is awarded to the contractor, the contractor is assigned a unique&nbsp;<abbr>AIEE</abbr>&nbsp;number and is informed by the Labour Program of Employment and Social Development Canada (<abbr>ESDC</abbr>-Labour) that they are now subject to the&nbsp;<abbr>FCP</abbr>.</p>
										<p>By signing an&nbsp;<abbr>AIEE</abbr>, contractors agree to implement and maintain employment equity within their workplace. This agreement is in force from the moment of receipt of an initial federal government goods and services contract, a standing offer, or a supply arrangement valued at $1&nbsp;million or more (including applicable taxes). The contractor is required to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>collect workforce information;</li>
											<li>complete a workforce analysis;</li>
											<li>establish short-term and long-term numerical goals; and</li>
											<li>make reasonable progress and reasonable efforts.</li>
