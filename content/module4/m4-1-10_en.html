				<p>Mr.&nbsp;Smith, the Director General of the Health Program Initiatives Directorate (<abbr>HPID</abbr>), is looking to organize and carry out a symposium on Canadian research capacity in the area of “memory in normal aging and dementia.” The information coming out of this symposium could potentially be used by the department as one input among many to arrive at a policy statement and future action plan.</p>
				<p>The symposium would bring together the best Canadian scientists to share their views and report on their research findings in this important area. The department expects that the symposium would greatly benefit the health research community and the pharmaceutical industry as the information presented at the symposium would bring forward a wide array of current thinking on the issue.</p>
				<p>Mr.&nbsp;Smith would like you, as the contracting officer, to award a $22,000 contract to the 3H&nbsp;Society of Canada since it has expressed an interest in organizing the symposium as a means to advance its own work on its selected theme. If awarded the contract, the society would organize the symposium from top to bottom, including securing presenters, setting up the facilities, procuring simultaneous translation services, selecting chairs, advertising and promotion, preparing and publishing proceedings, etc. Mr.&nbsp;Smith informs you that you could probably award the contract directly to the 3H&nbsp;Society of Canada under the terms and conditions of the department’s existing Health Grants and Contributions Program. The department has the authority to make transfer payments under this program and the 3H&nbsp;Society is eligible to receive such payments.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Based on the information provided, a contract should not be awarded to the 3H&nbsp;Society of Canada for the organization of the symposium. The description of the work required, along with the last piece of information provided by Mr.&nbsp;Smith, support the notion that, in this case, a transfer payment (grant or contribution) should be the vehicle used to pay the 3H&nbsp;Society of Canada for organizing the symposium.</p>
										<p>Transfer payments are monetary payments, or transfers of goods, services or assets to third parties, including Crown corporations, on the basis of an appropriation. Transfer payments do not result in the acquisition by the Government of Canada of any goods, services or assets. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=13525&amp;section=HTML" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Policy on Transfer Payments">Policy on Transfer Payments</a>&nbsp;explains the roles and responsibilities for the delivery and management of transfer payment programs.</p>
										<p>Contracting officers should be aware of two specific types of transfer payments—grants and contributions—and the distinction between grants and contributions and contracts.</p>
										<p>Grants are transfer payments subject to pre‑established eligibility and other entitlement criteria. A grant is neither subject to being accounted for by a recipient nor normally subject to audit by the department. The recipient may be required to report on results achieved.</p>
										<p>Contributions are transfer payments subject to performance conditions specified in a funding agreement. A contribution is to be accounted for and is subject to audit.</p>
										<p>Payments that are made in exchange for goods or services are contracts, the majority of which are considered Crown procurement contracts subject to the Government Contracts Regulations, the various trade agreements, and the Treasury Board Contracting Policy.</p>
										<p>The key differences between grants and contributions and Crown procurement contracts are:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The purpose of contracts is to acquire goods or services whereas grants and contributions allow participants to gain something that furthers government objectives; and</li>
											<li>The beneficiary of a contract is the department itself whereas the Canadian public at large benefits from grants and contributions.</li>
