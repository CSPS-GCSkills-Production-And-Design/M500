										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>No.</p>
										<p>Since the supplier has been suspended by&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;under the Integrity Regime, you should not award a contract to this bidder.</p>
										<p><abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;is responsible for administering the Integrity Regime, which includes the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy, on behalf of Canada, making ineligibility and suspension determinations, and entering into administrative agreements.</p>
										<p>When&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;determines that a supplier is ineligible to enter, or suspended from entering, into a contract, it will enter the name of the supplier in its Integrity Database as an ineligible or suspended supplier. Where a department or agency has the authority to contract, the determinations made by&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;under the Policy may be relied upon by that department or agency when making a decision on whether to enter into a contract with a supplier.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;Ineligibility and Suspension List is available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/four-inel-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Ineligible and suspended suppliers under the Integrity Regime">Ineligible and suspended suppliers under the Integrity Regime</a>.</p>
										<h3>What is the Integrity Regime?</h3>
										<p>The Integrity Regime consists of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/politique-policy-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Content">Ineligibility and Suspension Policy</a>, any directives issued further to the policy, and any clauses used in instruments relating to contracts or real property agreements that incorporate the policy by reference.</p>
										<h3><abbr>MOU</abbr>s with departments and agencies</h3>
										<p>The Integrity Regime is governed by Memorandums of Understanding between&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;and other departments and agencies (<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ci-if/pe-mou-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Departments and agencies that follow the Integrity Regime">Departments and agencies that follow the Integrity Regime</a>). The MOU is the instrument that allows&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;to provide verification services to client departments and agencies under the Integrity Regime. It outlines the application of the MOU, roles and responsibilities, the description and scope of the service, service standards, procedures for emergency situations, performance tracking and reporting, handling of information, dispute management, and communications.</p>
										<h3>The Process</h3>
										<p>The Ineligibility and Suspension Policy sets out the circumstances in which&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;may declare ineligible or suspend a supplier from being awarded a contract or real property agreement with Canada. It also sets out the ineligibility and suspension periods, the criteria for invoking the public interest exception, the process for entering into an administrative agreement, and the reduction to a period of ineligibility available pursuant to an administrative agreement. The policy applies to most goods and services contracts, and construction contracts valued at $10,000 or more (exceptions are listed in section 4b of the policy).</p>
										<p>When submitting a bid, a bidder must certify that they have read, understood, and comply with the Ineligibility and Suspension Policy.</p>
										<p>Suppliers<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;that have been charged with, or convicted of, one of the offences listed below in the past three years can be declared ineligible for a period of 5 or 10 years (or longer in cases where a supplier is without capacity to contract pursuant to section 750(3) of the Criminal Code):</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Payment of a contingency fee to a person to whom the Lobbying Act applies;</li>
											<li>Corruption, collusion, bid rigging or any other anti-competitive activity under the Competition Act;</li>
											<li>Money laundering;</li>
											<li>Participation in activities of criminal organizations;</li>
											<li>Income and excise tax evasion;</li>
											<li>Bribing a foreign public official;</li>
											<li>Offences in relation to drug trafficking;</li>
											<li>Extortion;</li>
											<li>Bribery of judicial officers;</li>
											<li>Bribery of officers;</li>
											<li>Secret commissions;</li>
											<li>Criminal breach of contracts;</li>
											<li>Fraudulent manipulation of stock exchange transactions;</li>
											<li>Prohibited insider trading;</li>
											<li>Forgery and other offences resembling forgery; and</li>
											<li>Falsification of books and documents.</li>
										</ul>
										<p><sup>1</sup>Suppliers are “persons” which include, but are not limited to individuals, organizations, bodies corporate, societies, companies, firms, partnerships, and associations of persons.</p>
										<p>In addition, contracting officers must be aware that conviction under sections 121, 124, 380 and 418 of the&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Criminal Code">Criminal Code of Canada</a>&nbsp;denies the capacity to contract with the Crown, unless the Governor in Council under section 750(3) has restored (in whole or in part) this capacity to the individual or the individual has been granted a pardon.</p>
