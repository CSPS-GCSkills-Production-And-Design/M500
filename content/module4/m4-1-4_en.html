One day after you get the file, you receive a telephone call from Mr.&nbsp;Bill Bright of Human Behaviour Research Inc. Mr.&nbsp;Bright informs you that he is aware of an upcoming government requirement for R&amp;D services related to human behaviour (referring to the requirement that you are working on). Mr.&nbsp;Bright asks to meet with you so that he can introduce himself and his company. You agree to meet for a brief introductory meeting at the coffee shop in the lobby of your place of work. The meeting goes very well and at the end, as a sign of appreciation, Mr.&nbsp;Bright shakes your hand and gives you a pair of first-row centre-ice tickets to the next home game of the local&nbsp;<abbr title="National Hockey League">NHL</abbr>&nbsp;hockey team. What do you do? Provide the rationale for your decision.</p>

							<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-8"><p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>You should thank Mr.&nbsp;Bright but give him back the tickets. As stated in Appendix&nbsp;B of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25178&amp;section=HTML" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Content">Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment</a>, regarding gifts, public servants are not to accept any gifts, hospitality or other benefits that may have a real, apparent or potential influence on their objectivity in carrying out their official duties and responsibilities or that may place them under obligation to the donor. This includes activities such as free or discounted admission to sporting and cultural events, travel or conferences.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25178&amp;section=HTML" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Content">Policy on Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment</a>&nbsp;also provides direction and measures to assist organizations and public servants in effectively dealing with real, potential and apparent conflict of interest situations that may arise during and after employment in the public service.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=25049" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</a>&nbsp;outlines the values and expected behaviours that guide public servants in all activities related to their professional duties. By committing to these values and adhering to the expected behaviours, public servants strengthen the ethical culture of the public sector and contribute to public confidence in the integrity of all public institutions.</p>

<p>In addition, public servants must also adhere to the behaviours outlined in their individual organizational code. Organizational codes are consistent with the Code, but outline behaviours specific to the unique mandate and work environment of each department or agency.</p>
