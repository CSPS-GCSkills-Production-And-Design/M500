							<p>Departmental investment planning is the function of allocating and reallocating resources to new and existing assets and acquired services that are essential to program delivery. Departmental investment planning is a key element in achieving value for money and sound stewardship.</p>
							<p>Under the investment planning lens, client needs are considered over a long-term horizon. Unless there is sustained investment in its asset base, a department’s ability to deliver on its mandate erodes over time. The investments that are proposed in such a plan are carefully chosen to maximize capabilities within the available resources that are allocated in a manner that clearly supports program outcomes and government priorities. Integrated investment planning is a critical activity that ensures the government’s ongoing ability to deliver the highest quality service to Canadians.</p>

							<p>The <a href="#">Policy Framework for the Management of Assets and Acquired Services</a> and its associated policy instruments set the direction for the management of assets and acquired services to ensure that the conduct of these activities provides value for money and demonstrates sound stewardship in program delivery. The policy framework establishes the principles that should govern the work of the procurement, materiel management, and real property communities; these principles are in keeping with the <a href="#">Management Accountability Framework</a> and are grounded in the <a href="#">Values and Ethics Code for the Public Sector</a>.</p>
							<p>The policy framework centres on the characteristics of an effective departmental management framework and the broad principles that should guide decision making rather than provide prescriptive, transaction-focused direction.</p>
							<p>Deputy heads are accountable to their respective ministers and to Treasury Board for the management of departmental assets and acquired services. They are responsible for implementing an effective management framework, including departmental procedures, processes and systems that demonstrate how the department is managing based on the principles of procurement best practices.</p>
							<p>The policy framework also identifies the key statutory, regulatory and policy instruments such as the <a href="#">Financial Administration Act</a>, the <a href="#">Government Contracts Regulations</a>, and the <a href="#">Common Services Policy</a> that form the basis for the government’s management practices and controls.</p>
