                                        <p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, given the fact that the final delivery of the work will be on Aboriginal territories, Aboriginal considerations must be taken into account and carefully examined prior to undertaking this procurement process.</p>
                                        <p>The federal government, represented by Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (<abbr title="Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada">CIRNAC</abbr>), has negotiated a number of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100030577/1100100030578" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Website">Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements</a>&nbsp;(<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements">CLCA</abbr>s) with Aboriginal peoples.&nbsp;<abbr title="Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements">CLCA</abbr>s are modern treaties that are based on the concept of continued Aboriginal rights and title to lands traditionally used and occupied by an Aboriginal group, which have not been dealt with by treaty or other legal means.</p>
                                        <p>Modern treaties (CLCAs) are laws. The modern treaty (CLCA) obligations are legally binding because they are contained in agreements signed by Canada and backed by legislation. Furthermore, the Aboriginal rights detailed within them are constitutionally protected under <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-16.html" class="external" target="_blank">section&nbsp;35</a> of the Constitution Act 1982.</p>
                                        <p>Most modern treaties (CLCAs) include measures dealing with procurement, and although these measures are not always identical in the various agreements, they are all aimed at enhancing the economic opportunities of the Aboriginal group benefiting from the agreement, usually through increased possibilities of competing successfully for contracts in their settlement areas or of participating in employment, training or subcontracting opportunities.</p>
                                        <p>Canada&rsquo;s procurement obligations vary with each modern treaty (CLCA), but can include:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Separating requirements into commodity or geographic groupings, whenever practical and consistent with sound procurement management, to permit smaller and more specialized firms to submit bids;</li>
                                            <li>Notification of the procurement to the land claimant groups and/or modern treaty (CLCA) beneficiary firms;</li>
                                            <li>Use of modern treaty (CLCA) business directories/lists;</li>
                                            <li>Use of bid evaluation criteria to benefit modern treaty (CLCA) beneficiaries, subject to international obligations, and wherever practical and consistent with sound procurement management; and</li>
                                            <li>Right of first refusal for procurements related to certain topics (e.g.&nbsp;archaeology, heritage, parks, surveying).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>During the procurement planning stage, the contracting officer must determine whether any modern treaties (CLCAs) apply, and, if so, how they will affect the procurement strategy. The contracting officer must also ensure that the procurement file contains adequate documentation on the measures taken to address any modern treaty (CLCA) procurement obligations.</p>
                                        <p>As some of the wording in the agreements is vague and open to interpretation, contracting personnel are discouraged from applying their own interpretation to the agreements. Legal and policy advice should be sought if there is any doubt as to how the agreement should be interpreted. Consult section&nbsp;9.35.5 of the PSPC <em>Supply Manual</em> for more information on the <a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/9/35#section-9.35.5" class="external" target="_blank">modern treaties in effect</a>.</p>
                                        <p>In this particular situation, the trail maintenance work will be carried out within the territory covered by the Umbrella Final Agreement between the Government of Canada, the Council for Yukon Indians and the Government of the Yukon, and the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Final Agreement (CLCA).</p>
                                        <p>Under the terms of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Final Agreement, Canadian Parks Service shall provide the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations with a right of first refusal for construction and maintenance of trails. As the contracting officer for this file, you would have to provide notice of the contracting opportunity to the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations, and solicit bids from Champagne and Aishihik firms.</p>
                                        <p>Where the procurement is subject to modern treaty (CLCA) contracting obligations, it can also, in certain cases, be subject to a set-aside under the PSAB. To the extent that the application of a PSAB set-aside does not interfere with modern treaty (CLCA) contracting obligations, then both the modern treaty (CLCA) and PSAB procedures may be applied, but when the two are in conflict, the modern treaty (CLCA) contracting obligations take precedence.</p>
