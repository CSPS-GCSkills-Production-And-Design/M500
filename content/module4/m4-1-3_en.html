The&nbsp;<abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>&nbsp;knows that a former director from another department (former public servant in receipt of a pension) is qualified and available immediately to perform this task at a per‑diem rate of $1,200. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Director General">DG</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that given the per‑diem rate and expected duration of the contract, the value of the contract would be just over $50,000.</p>

<p>The <a href="#">Government Contracts Regulations</a> (<abbr>GCRs</abbr>) prescribe the conditions for entering into Crown procurement contracts and for dealing with financial security.</p>

<p><a href="#">Part&nbsp;I of the Government Contracts Regulations</a> sets out the conditions of contract entry.

<p>Part&nbsp;I of the <abbr>GCR</abbr>s also provides for the making of advance and progress payments. Part&nbsp;II of the <abbr>GCR</abbr>s sets out conditions for bid and contract security and Part&nbsp;III sets out the terms that are deemed to be expressly specified in every bid solicitation and contract for construction, goods or services that provide for the payment of any money by Her Majesty.</p>

							<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-8"><p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>No, unless you first obtain Treasury Board approval to do so.</p>

<p>Article&nbsp;16.8 of the Contracting Policy states that contracts for the services of former public servants in receipt of a pension or of a lump‑sum payment are to bear the closest public scrutiny and reflect fairness in the spending of public funds. There must be no suggestion of favouritism or special privilege.</p>

<p>For a non‑competitive contract with a former public servant in receipt of a pension, a contracting authority may enter into and amend a contract until its total value (including amendments) equals $25,000. Treasury Board approval is required to enter into and amend any non‑competitive contract with a former public servant in receipt of a pension whose total value (including amendments) exceeds $25,000. You therefore could not award a $50,000 non‑competitive contract to a former public servant in receipt of a pension without first obtaining Treasury Board approval.</p>

									<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-10"><p>Additional information on contracts with former public servants in receipt of a pension.</p>

<p>For a competitive contract with a former public servant in receipt of a pension, a contracting authority may enter into and amend a contract until its total value (including amendments) equals $100,000. The approval of the Treasury Board is required to amend any contract with a former public servant when its total value (including amendments) exceeds $100,000.</p>

<p>Fee‑Abatement Policy</p>

<p>Non‑competitive contracts for the services of former public servants who have been retired for less than one year and who are in receipt of a pension must include a contract fee that is abated in accordance with a formula developed by Treasury Board Secretariat and described below. This policy does not apply to competitive contracts, including contracts where an Advance Contract Award Notice (<abbr>ACAN</abbr>) was published and no valid statements of capabilities were received.</p>

<p>The following procedure applies to the determination of the maximum per‑diem rate for the services of a former public servant in receipt of a pension:</p>

<p>The previous maximum salary is updated to the current level, or the estimated salary for having the work done by a public servant (if a qualified public servant were available), whichever is less, plus 30% (representing a fringe-benefit factor), minus the total annual (gross) pension in pay, yields a figure that is divided by 260&nbsp;(representing the number of working days in a year), equals the maximum daily rate that can be negotiated.</p>

<p>For example, if a public servant retired at a salary of $75,000 and is receiving an annual pension of $45,000, the formula would be:</p>
</div>
									<img class="img-responsive text-center" src="content/medias/images/pension_formula.jpg" alt="(($75,000 + $22,500*) - $45,000)/260 = $201.92 (maximum allowable daily rate) *30% of $75,000 = $22,500">
									<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-11"><p>If the above formula yields a rate lower than that negotiated and agreed to, the negotiated rate should be used. The contract amount should be adjusted appropriately where the fee is a fixed price based on a number of days of work or where the fee is paid on the basis of hourly, weekly, monthly or annual rates. The number of hours that will constitute a work day should be based on the usually accepted norm for the profession, trade or function being contracted and should be specified in the contract document.</p>

<p>Lump‑Sum Payment</p>

<p>Former public servants in receipt of a lump‑sum payment are those former employees who have received a lump‑sum payment made pursuant to the Public Sector Compensation Act as provided in the Work Force Adjustment Directive (<abbr>WFAD</abbr>) or other <abbr>TB</abbr> employment transition programs, and former members of the Armed Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in receipt of lump‑sum payments through corresponding force-reduction programs.</p>

<p>Competitive and non‑competitive contracts for the services of a former public servant in receipt of a lump‑sum payment are subject to a special remuneration policy whereby the total fee payable cannot exceed $5,000 during the lump‑sum payment period. This limit applies cumulatively to all contracts. The lump‑sum payment period is defined as the period, measured in weeks of salary, for which payment has been made to facilitate the transition to retirement or to other employment. The lump‑sum payment period does not include the period of severance pay, which is measured in a like manner.</p>

<p>After the lump‑sum payment period is completed, the one‑year fee‑abatement period begins for any non-competitive contracts with a former public servant in receipt of a pension.</p>

						<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-12"><p>Let’s assume that a traditional competitive bidding process is undertaken to meet a <abbr>DG</abbr>’s requirement and that six firms or individuals are invited to submit a bid. On bid closing day, you pick up the bids from your department’s bid receiving unit (five bids were submitted). Upon opening and examining the bids, you notice the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two bids from two different bidders are in the same envelope. The proposed prices from the two bidders are significantly higher than what was originally anticipated considering the level of effort.</li>
	<li>Two other bids, submitted separately, contain identical irregularities (same spelling mistakes and same miscalculations). Their proposed prices are also significantly higher than what was originally anticipated based on the level of effort.</li>
	<li>A fifth bid is submitted in the prescribed format and it meets all of the mandatory criteria. This bidder’s proposed price is lower than all the other bidders’ prices but still considerably higher than what was originally anticipated based on the level of effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>What could these irregularities possibly suggest? What should you do about them?</p>

							<div class="LOM-editable" id="LOM-edit-13"><p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>This could be a sign that bid-rigging is taking place. In this case, you must notify your immediate supervisor and Legal Services since there is an indication of possible bid-rigging activities, collusion or fraud.</p>

<p>Bid‑rigging refers to a secret agreement between suppliers in a bid solicitation process, so that one or more suppliers do not bid at all, or they agree on the prices and terms of their bids. Bid-rigging has serious negative economic consequences for businesses and for the public. It is also a crime. Canada’s Competition Act prohibits bid-rigging and provides for penalties, on conviction, of up to 14&nbsp;years in jail and fines at the discretion of the courts.</p>

<p>The <a href="#">Competition Act</a> is a federal law governing most business conduct in Canada. It contains both criminal and civil provisions aimed at preventing anti‑competitive practices in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The criminal provisions of the Competition Act include those covering conspiracies that unduly lessen competition, bid‑rigging, price discrimination, predatory pricing, and price maintenance.</p>

<p>Bid‑rigging can target bids in any sector: all products and services are at risk.</p>

<p>There are a number of warning signs that bids may be rigged. Contracting officers must be on guard throughout the procurement process. Visit the Competition Bureau’s <a href="#">toolbox for procurement</a> on bid‑rigging: detecting, preventing and reporting to learn more.</p>

<p>When it is considered necessary, Legal Services will assist in subsequent discussions with the Competition Bureau Canada, the federal independent law enforcement agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act.</p>

<p>The Competition Bureau is the agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act. Headed by the Commissioner of Competition, the organization investigates anti-competitive practices and promotes compliance with the laws under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The <a href="#">Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</a> is legislation governing insolvency and bankruptcy. It sets out the rights and responsibilities of all the individuals and institutions with an interest or involvement in the affairs of an insolvent or bankrupt person. These include the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, the receivers, the court, the trustees, the creditors, and the debtors.</p>

<p>This Act has an impact on procurement activities in that it identifies the rights and responsibilities of the Crown and its contractors and their subcontractors should a contractor or subcontractor become insolvent or bankrupt during the life of a Crown procurement contract.</p>
