                <p>You are assigned a contract request from the director general (<abbr>DG</abbr>) responsible for the Finance and Administration Branch in your department, who requires the services of a consultant to conduct an independent review of the accounts payable processes in the department. The&nbsp;<abbr>DG</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that this review could be achieved by one expert consultant and that a report, including findings and recommendations, could be delivered within two months of the start of the contract. The&nbsp;<abbr>DG</abbr>&nbsp;knows that a former director from another department (former public servant in receipt of a pension) is qualified and available immediately to perform this task at a per‑diem rate of $1,200. The&nbsp;<abbr>DG</abbr>&nbsp;estimates that given the per‑diem rate and expected duration of the contract, the value of the contract would be just over $50,000.</p>

In this case, you must notify your immediate supervisor and Legal Services since there is an indication of possible bid-rigging activities, collusion or fraud.</p>

<p>Bid‑rigging refers to a secret agreement between suppliers in a bid solicitation process, so that one or more suppliers do not bid at all, or they agree on the prices and terms of their bids. Bid-rigging has serious negative economic consequences for businesses and for the public. It is also a crime. Canada’s Competition Act prohibits bid-rigging and provides for penalties, on conviction, of up to 14&nbsp;years in jail and fines at the discretion of the courts.</p>

<p>The <a href="#" data-ext="ext-wb-48" class="external">Competition Act</a> is a federal law governing most business conduct in Canada. It contains both criminal and civil provisions aimed at preventing anti‑competitive practices in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The criminal provisions of the Competition Act include those covering conspiracies that unduly lessen competition, bid‑rigging, price discrimination, predatory pricing, and price maintenance.</p>

<p>Bid‑rigging can target bids in any sector: all products and services are at risk.</p>

<p>There are a number of warning signs that bids may be rigged. Contracting officers must be on guard throughout the procurement process. Visit the Competition Bureau’s <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-54">toolbox for procurement</a> on bid‑rigging: detecting, preventing and reporting to learn more.</p>

<p>When it is considered necessary, Legal Services will assist in subsequent discussions with the Competition Bureau Canada, the federal independent law enforcement agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act.</p>

<p>The Competition Bureau is the agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act. Headed by the Commissioner of Competition, the organization investigates anti-competitive practices and promotes compliance with the laws under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>In addition, the <em>Government Contracts Regulations</em> include deemed terms that mitigate the risk of corruption and collusion in the bidding process.</p>

                                        <p>Former public servants in receipt of a lump-sum payment are those former employees who have received a lump-sum payment made pursuant to the <em>Public Sector Compensation Act</em> as provided in the Work Force Adjustment Directive (<abbr>WFAD</abbr>) or other <abbr>TB</abbr> employment transition programs, and former members of the Armed Forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in receipt of lump-sum payments through corresponding force-reduction programs.</p>

This limit applies cumulatively to all contracts. The lump-sum payment period is defined as the period, measured in weeks of salary, for which payment has been made to facilitate the transition to retirement or to other employment. The lump-sum payment period does not include the period of severance pay, which is measured in a like manner.</p>
