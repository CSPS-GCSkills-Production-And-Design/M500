                <p>Your procurement team leader forwards an e‑mail request to you from a manager in your department. This manager needs to procure a Leica&nbsp;S (Type&nbsp;007) medium-format&nbsp;<abbr>DSLR</abbr>&nbsp;camera and a Leica 30–90‑mm f/3.5–5.6 Vario–Elmar‑S&nbsp;<abbr>ASPH</abbr>&nbsp;lens (full specifications and information provided in the e‑mail). This equipment has an estimated dollar value of close to $40,000. The manager, who is new to the department (and to government), wants to know if his e‑mail request will suffice and how long you think it would take for you to get this camera for him.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>No, you cannot proceed with the procurement of this camera.</p>
                                        <p>First, the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-3">Financial Administration Act (FAA)</a> provides the legal structure for the collection and use of public funds. Sections&nbsp;32, 33, 34 are of direct interest to contracting officers, as seen in the video on <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-46">The Impact of Delegation of Financial Authorities on Your Day‑to‑Day Work</a> in Module&nbsp;3.</p>
                                        <p>In this situation, assuming the requesting manager has the authority to commit funds, he would have to provide an appropriate contract request form, along with a detailed description of the requirement, in order for the contracting officer to undertake the procurement process.</p>
                                        <p>Second, sections 6 and 7 of the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-47">Department of Public Works and Government Services Act</a> outlines in detail the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr>PSPC</abbr>), including the acquisition of services.</p>
                                        <p>Section 9 of the Act gives the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> the <strong>exclusive authority for the acquisition of goods</strong>. All ministers have inherent power to contract; however, the authority given to the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> in section 9 supplants the authority of each department to contract for goods. That authority may be restored through a delegation by the Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr>, in accordance with section 8 of the Act. The Minister of <abbr>PSPC</abbr> has currently delegated her authority to contract for goods to other ministers up to a value of $25,000.</p>
                                        <p>Assuming there are no standing offers in place for this type of equipment, and since the estimated value of the required sophisticated camera is greater than $25,000, the request to contract for this good would have to be handled by <abbr>PSPC</abbr> on behalf of the department.</p>
                                        <p>And finally, although you would not be handling this procurement process, the requester should be reminded of the <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-45">Policy on Green Procurement</a>, which aims to reduce the environmental impacts of government operations and to promote environmental stewardship. Green procurement is set within the context of achieving value for money, requiring that the best compromise of procurement objectives—including environmental benefits—be achieved.</p>
                                        <p>There are numerous practical considerations to be made during each of the procurement phases, to ensure environmental factors are included in procurement decisions. In this particular scenario, key considerations for the procurement planning process could include specification of packaging requirements that are less damaging to the environment, such as:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>minimal packaging</li>
                                            <li>reusable or recyclable packaging</li>
                                            <li>use of return-to-vendor programs as alternates to waste disposal</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Overall, the application of the Policy on Green Procurement will benefit the environment by contributing to such environmental objectives as:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air contaminants</li>
                                            <li>improving energy and water efficiency</li>
                                            <li>reducing ozone-depleting substances</li>
                                            <li>reducing waste and supporting reuse and recycling</li>
                                            <li>reducing hazardous waste</li>
                                            <li>reducing toxic and hazardous chemicals and substances</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>You are encouraged to be familiar with the requirements of this policy and to take the Canada School of Public Service online course, <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-csps-1">C215 – Green Procurement</a>.</p>
