										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>In this situation, given the fact that Mr.&nbsp;Schwartz would not be performing legal services, but rather an audit on two accounts payable files under this contract, you would most likely be able to award the contract, after receiving approval from the Department of Justice.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Table of Contents">Government Contracts Regulations</a>&nbsp;require that contracts for the performance of legal services may be entered into only by or under the authority of the Minister of Justice. Accordingly, while it is recognized that lawyers may be engaged for purposes other than the performance of legal services, the Department of Justice must be consulted in every case where a contract for services is entered into with a practising member of the bar, to determine whether the contract is for legal services and thus whether the approval of the Department of Justice is required. No contracting authority may enter into a contract for services with a practising member of the bar without first having obtained the approval of the Department of Justice, or having been advised by the Department of Justice that the contract does not involve legal services. Note that the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/abt-apd/la-man/conpol-polcon/contract-marche.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Policy on Contracting for Legal Services and Legal Agent Appointment">Policy on Contracting for Legal Services and Legal Agent Appointment</a>&nbsp;states that contracts for the performance of legal services entered into by or under the authority of the Minister of Justice are otherwise not subject to the requirements of the Government Contracts Regulations or the Treasury Board Contracting Policy.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Dan Dean should file his complaint with the&nbsp;<a href="http://opo-boa.gc.ca/index-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Website">Office of the Procurement Ombudsman</a>.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://opo-boa.gc.ca/index-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Website">Office of the Procurement Ombudsman</a>&nbsp;(<abbr>OPO</abbr>) is an independent organization with a government-wide mandate. The position of Procurement Ombudsman was created by amendments to the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act enacted pursuant to the Federal Accountability Act, which received Royal Assent on December&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2006. The Office's overall objective is to strengthen the fairness, openness and transparency of federal procurement.</p>
										<p>The Procurement Ombudsman reports to the Minister of&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;and is mandated to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Review complaints with respect to the awarding of a contract for the acquisition of goods below $26,400 and services below $105,700 (including taxes);</li>
											<li>Review complaints with respect to the administration of a contract, regardless of dollar value;</li>
											<li>Review the practices of departments for acquiring goods and services and make recommendations where necessary to improve those practices;</li>
											<li>Ensure that an alternative dispute-resolution process is provided, if both parties agree to participate;</li>

									<p>Let’s assume that during the execution of the work, the contractor’s performance is less than stellar. Even though the scope of the contract was quite clear and understood by the contractor at the kick‑off meeting, your client is not satisfied with the work. Some of the issues encountered are as follows:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Contractor needs constant guidance;</li>
										<li>Contractor was late on some deliverables;</li>
										<li>Quality of deliverables not quite up to par; and</li>
										<li>Contractor not always present at meetings or often late.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>In the end, the contractor reduces the original contract price by more than 60% of the original value, and both parties agree to terminate the contract by mutual consent.</p>
									<p>Are there any reasonable measures that can be taken to ensure that the department can rely on its vendors to perform their obligations? Can the department assess a vendor’s performance, and take action to prevent future problems, based on the vendor’s past performance?</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>It depends on whether or not your department or agency has implemented an internal vendor performance policy.</p>
										<p>Most departments and agencies have implemented vendor performance policies whereby corrective measures are applied against vendors who do not fulfill their contractual obligations. Such measures can have an impact on a vendor’s ability to bid on future opportunities with or to receive contracts from a department or agency. Vendor performance measures can vary from simple conditions to longer-term debarment.</p>
										<p>In departments with existing vendor performance policies, contracting officers must verify the appropriate departmental database or system prior to evaluating bids or awarding contracts to confirm if measures have been applied against any vendor (bidder). Appropriate departmental procedures must be adhered to in cases where measures have been applied against a bidder.</p>
										<p>Where&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;handles procurements on behalf of departments and agencies,&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;has implemented its&nbsp;<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/8/180" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy">Vendor Performance Corrective Measure Policy</a>. This policy standardizes the processes and procedures pertaining to the application of Vendor Performance Corrective Measures (<abbr>VPCM</abbr>).</p>
