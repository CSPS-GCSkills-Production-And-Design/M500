										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes. In this situation, the Crown would not want to limit contractor liability but would want to be protected against potential damages caused by the vaccine (e.g.&nbsp;illness, disease, disorder, malady or even death). Consultation with the legal department would be required to formulate appropriate clauses for inclusion in the&nbsp;<abbr>RFP</abbr>&nbsp;and resulting contract.</p>
										<p>In contractual matters, contractors are responsible for managing risks and liabilities under their control. The Crown is responsible for managing risks under its control and for losses arising from those risks. This division of responsibility reflects both the common and civil law. Based on this legal principle, the Crown may or may not include a clause (or clauses) in Crown procurement contracts to ensure that it is protected from losses caused either by the contractor's performance of the contract or from the performance of the product or service delivered.</p>
										<p>The following is a sample clause that has been used in previous similar contracts to ensure the Crown is properly protected:</p>
										<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
											<li>The Contractor will indemnify and save harmless Canada, Provinces and Territories and their servants and agents from and against any damages, costs or expenses or any claim, action suit or other proceeding which they or any of them may at any time incur or suffer as a result of or arising out of:
												<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
													<li>any injury to persons (including injuries resulting in death) or loss of or damage to property or others which may be or be alleged to be caused by or suffered as a result of the performance of the Work or any part of the Work, except that Canada, Provinces and Territories will not claim indemnity under this section to the extent that the injury, loss or damage has been caused by Canada, Provinces or Territories; and</li>
													<li>any liens, attachments, charges or other encumbrances or claims upon or in respect of any materials, parts, work-in-process or finished work to, or in respect of which any payment has been made by Canada, Provinces and Territories.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>Canada will give notice to the Contractor of any claim, action, suit or proceeding referred to above, and the Contractor will, to the extent requested by the Attorney General of Canada or of any Province or Territory, at its own expense participate in or conduct the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding and any negotiations for settlement of the same, but the Contractor will not be liable to indemnify Canada, Provinces and Territories for payment of any settlement unless it has consented to the settlement.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>In certain circumstances, it is in the public interest for the Crown to assume all or part of a contractor's potential liabilities. This transfer of potential risk or liabilities is set out in a limitation of liability or indemnification clause. The&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>&nbsp;<a  href="#" class="external" data-ext="ext-wb-121" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Content">Policy on Decision Making in Limiting Contractor Liability in Crown Procurement Contracts</a>&nbsp;addresses the use of these clauses. It provides for a risk-based, administratively efficient management regime that responds to program delivery challenges, recognizes market place realities, and supports effective stewardship of public funds.</p>
										<p>Departments are required to use the risk-based models described in the policy to support decision making when using clauses indemnifying or limiting liabilities of contractors.</p>
										<p>When the decision is made to limit a contractor's liability to the Crown, contracting officers, in conjunction with clients, must be able to demonstrate that the risks associated with the procurement have been analyzed and that the limitation of liability, if needed, provides adequate protection to the Crown.</p>
										<p>Decisions with respect to limiting a contractor’s liability should be made prior to release of the bid solicitation for competitive requirements, and for sole-source requirements, prior to initiation of negotiations.</p>
										<p>Finally, it is important to remember that unless a department or agency receives prior approval from Treasury Board, it cannot limit first or third-party liabilities or indemnify contractors.&nbsp;<abbr>PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<abbr>SSC</abbr>&nbsp;have the authority to limit first-party liabilities and, in defined and&nbsp;<abbr>TB</abbr>‑approved circumstances, to limit third-party liabilities.</p>
