									<p>In your bid solicitation document, you requested that bidders submit a bid security (financial) along with their bid. A bond or deposit is given to guarantee entry into a contract. This bond/deposit is given to indemnify Canada against increased costs if the bidder does not carry out the specified undertaking to enter into a contract.</p>
									<p>At bid closing time, six bids had been received. All bids received included the required security deposit (certified cheques). Your client informs you that he will not be in a position to award a contract for the work until three months from now. Until the contract is awarded, should you cash and deposit the certified cheques submitted by the bidders? Provide the rationale for your decision.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>No, you should not cash and deposit the certified cheques. A certified cheque submitted as a security deposit with a tender for a contract is to be held uncashed until the successful bid is selected or for up to one year, whichever comes first.</p>
										<p>As stated in&nbsp;<a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-87-402/page-2.html#h-9" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Part II of the Government Contracts Regulations">Part II of the Government Contracts Regulations</a>, security deposits received from bidders must be dealt with as follow:</p>
										<p><strong>“12</strong>&nbsp;A contracting authority shall hold any bid bond, payment bond, performance bond or non-negotiable security deposit that is received by the authority until the terms of the security are fulfilled.</p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>13 (1)</strong>&nbsp;Where a negotiable security deposit is received by a contracting authority as bid security, the contracting authority shall hold that security deposit until it can be disposed of in accordance with subsection (2) or (3).</li>
											<li><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;Where a bid is accepted and contract security is required to be provided,
												<ol>
													<li><strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;the contracting authority shall continue to hold the security deposit referred to in subsection (1) until the contract security is provided; and</li>
													<li><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;when the contract security is provided, the contracting authority shall return the security deposit referred to in subsection (1) to the person from whom it was received unless it forms part of the contract security, in which case it shall be retained as contract security.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;Where a bid is rejected, or is accepted but contract security is not required, the contracting authority shall return the security deposit referred to in subsection (1) to the person from whom it was received.&nbsp;<strong>”</strong></li>

										<p>Departments are responsible for protecting sensitive information and assets under their control according to the security policy and its operational standards. This responsibility applies to all phases of the procurement process, including bidding, negotiating, awarding, performance and termination of contracts, as well as to internal government operations.</p>

The department may itself ensure that the contractor meets the appropriate security requirements or request that&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;perform this task.</p>
										<p>For contracts that are outside a department’s delegated contracting responsibilities and that involve access to sensitive information and assets,&nbsp;<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>&nbsp;is responsible for ensuring compliance with the appropriate security requirements.

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>When potential suppliers (contractors and subcontractors) need to be sponsored into the Contract Security Program, as a contracting officer, you can act as a sponsor and submit a written request to the Contract Security Program to initiate the company’s (supplier’s) registration (clearance) process.</p>
										<p>This request can be made in anticipation of opportunities to bid on future contracts with security requirements or when there is a strong possibility that the contractor and their personnel will require access to sensitive information, assets or secure sites at some future date.</p>
										<p>As a contracting officer, you must be in constant contact with the client and the security officer, and you must consider the time it will take the Contract Security Program to grant an organization security clearance and issue personnel security clearances to their employees because there may be impacts on timelines for awarding of the contract. Don’t forget that if the suppliers need to have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/organisation-organization/information-eng.html#s2c" rel="external" target="_blank" title="document safeguarding capability">document safeguarding capability</a>&nbsp;(<abbr title="Document Safeguarding Capability">DSC</abbr>) or one of its subsets,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/protection-safeguarding/securiteti-itsecurity-eng.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Information technology security requirements">information technology</a>&nbsp;(<abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/esc-src/organisation-organization/information-eng.html#s2d" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Production capability">production</a>, there will also be an&nbsp;<strong>impact on timelines</strong>.</p>
										<p>To be registered and screened through the Contract Security Program, organizations must first be sponsored by one of the following sources approved by the Government of Canada:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Federal government contracting officer</li>
											<li>Federal government security officer</li>
											<li>Federal government project officer</li>
										</ul>
										<p>For subcontracts, an approved source may be a private-sector organization (also called a prime contractor) already registered in the Contract Security Program and working on active contracts. The only instance where a prime contractor can sponsor a subcontractor without a valid contract in place is when a&nbsp;<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/policy-and-guidelines/supply-manual/section/9/5/1" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Major Crown Projects - General information">major Crown project</a>&nbsp;is involved and the client department confirms this project.</p>
