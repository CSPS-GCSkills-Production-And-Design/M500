				<p>Your department, Public Safety, is seeking to advance current understanding of youth delinquency and the transition to adult crime. To this end, it is seeking a contractor who will assemble a study group of academic researchers with relevant expertise to conduct a focused analysis of this topic using available Canadian data sources. The study group will consist of six to eight experts under the leadership and guidance of a principal investigator.</p>
				<p>The project authority (your client) will develop detailed work packages that are specific to each deliverable. The deliverables will consist of both scholarly research reports and summary bulletins highlighting the key findings and recommendations for policymakers and practitioners. To complete the work specified in each work package, the principal investigator will assign and manage resources accordingly, take responsibility for communication with the project authority and ensure the timely submission of deliverables.</p>
				<p>Although there is no security requirement for this contract, the contractor will be expected to treat any information related to this contract as confidential, during and after the performance of the services. Contract personnel requiring casual access to the installation sites during the contract do not require a security clearance but may be required to be escorted.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Definitely.</p>
										<p>The following treaties and agreements are currently in force:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Canada-Chile Free Trade Agreement (CCFTA)</li>
											<li>Canada-Colombia Free Trade Agreement</li>
											<li>Canada-Honduras Free Trade Agreement</li>
											<li>Canada-Korea Free Trade Agreement</li>
											<li>Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement</li>
											<li>Canada-Peru Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA)</li>
											<li>Canada–Ukraine Free Trade Agreement</li>
											<li>Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (European Union)</li>
											<li>Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)</li>
											<li>North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)</li>
											<li>World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (WTO AGP)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In July 2017, Canada also signed the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (<abbr title="Canadian Free Trade Agreement">CFTA</abbr>) with the provinces and territories. For procurement started or contracts issued prior to this date, it is the Agreement on Internal Trade (<abbr title="Agreement on Internal Trade">AIT</abbr>) that applies.</p>
										<p>Under all trade agreements, departments are required to comply with specific procedures when completing certain procurements. A decision must therefore be made as to whether or not the requirement is subject to a particular agreement or a combination of agreements. To determine coverage under the various trade agreements, the following elements must be reviewed:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The estimated procurement value (including the estimated amount of the Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales Tax);</li>
											<li>The department;</li>
											<li>The type of good or service or construction; and</li>
											<li>Any trade agreement exceptions or exclusions.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Contracting officers should note that when the procurement is covered by more than one agreement, all agreements must be complied with at the same time. In order to accomplish this, the procedures to be followed are the procedures that are considered the most rigorous.</p>
										<p>In this particular situation,</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The estimated dollar value of the contract exceeds the threshold for all trade agreements;</li>
											<li>Trade agreements are applicable to the department (Public Safety);</li>
											<li>The services that are required in this case (professional services/program research analysis) are covered by the trade agreements; and</li>
											<li>No trade agreement exceptions or exclusions apply in this situation.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>We can therefore say that trade agreements will have an impact on how you will proceed with this procurement.</p>
										<p>The trade agreements have several impacts on this procurement. The requirements must be publicly advertised by the “posting” of a notice of proposed procurement on a common known mechanism (i.e.&nbsp;the Government Electronic Tendering Service [<abbr title="Government Electronic Tendering Service">GETS</abbr>] on Buyandsell.gc.ca); the statement of work must describe the requirement generically enough that potential bidders outside of Canada will understand the terminology; the evaluation criteria and selection method must be identified to potential bidders; there can be no discrimination between domestic and foreign suppliers; and there is a formal bid challenge mechanism in place should potential bidders feel that the procurement process was not conducted in an open, fair, and transparent manner.</p>
										<p>Below, is key information concerning the trade agreements that Canada has signed.</p>

													<h4>Objective:</h4>
													<p>As stated in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, Canada committed to reducing trade barriers between Canada, the United States of America, and the Federal Republic of Mexico.

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>No.</p>
										<p>When bid solicitations are national in scope or originate from an office having the obligation to serve the public in both official languages (refer to List of&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-17" href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/psm-fpfm/ve/ol-lo/chap5_1-eng.asp" rel="external" target="_blank" title="List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes">Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes</a>), all regular or standardized documents must be provided in both official languages. This requirement also applies to public notices such as Notices of Proposed Procurement, terms and conditions, solicitation documents, standards, purchase descriptions, and contracts.</p>
										<p>For non standardized documents such as specifications, the federal institution initiating the requirement is responsible for determining if these documents must be available in both official languages. Such documents may be provided in only one official language when the institution determines and can substantiate that they will be requested in that language only.</p>
										<p>This requirement arises from Part IV of the&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-16" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-3.01/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Table of Contents">Official Languages Act</a>, which sets out the public’s right to communicate with and receive government services in either official language of Canada.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-16" href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/o-3.01/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Table of Contents">Official Languages Act</a>&nbsp;has three implications:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Any contract for the provision of services where the government department itself would be required to provide services in either official language must include a requirement for the contractor to provide the services in either official language.</li>
											<li>For contracts requiring Treasury Board (TB) approval, the TB submission must address how the requirements of the Act will be met under the contract.</li>
											<li>Suppliers must be dealt with in the official language of their choice, and should have access to information related to the procurement process in the official language of their choice.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>The purpose of the Official Languages Act is to ensure respect for English and French and the equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in federal institutions; to support the development of English and French linguistic minority communities; and to advance the equal status and use of English and French.</p>
										<p>In regions designated as bilingual for language-of-work purposes, both official languages are the languages of work. In unilingual regions, the language of work is generally the one that predominates in the province or territory. Treasury Board has published the&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-17" href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/psm-fpfm/ve/ol-lo/chap5_1-eng.asp" rel="external" target="_blank" title="List of Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes">Bilingual Regions of Canada for Language-of-Work Purposes</a>&nbsp;pursuant to subsection 35(2) of the Act.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, there are.</p>
										<p>The rates and allowances to be reimbursed for government business travel are stipulated in appendices&nbsp;B, C and&nbsp;D of the&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-93" href="https://www.njc-cnm.gc.ca/directive/travel-voyage/index-eng.php" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Travel Directive">Travel Directive</a>&nbsp;. Travel expenses must be treated as an amount payable under the contract for services rendered. All travel expenses payable should be specified and the costs should be included as part&nbsp;of the overall cost of the contract. Only original receipts can be accepted from contractors, photocopies of hotel bills, air tickets, etc. are not claimable.</p>
										<p>The objective of the Travel Directive is to ensure fair treatment of employees required to travel on government business, consistent with the principles of trust, flexibility, respect, valuing people, transparency, and modern travel practices. These principles underpin the management of government business travel and guide government employees in achieving fair, reasonable, and modern travel practices.</p>
										<p>While the Travel Directive applies to public servants, under the Treasury Board Contracting Policy, the directive also applies to travel costs incurred by contractors when these costs are a specific element of the contract. The Contracting Policy also states that while travel and living expenses should follow the contractor's established policy, under no circumstances may the amounts paid exceed the maximum permitted in the Travel Directive.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-94" href="http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/psm-fpfm/pay-remuneration/travel-deplacements/sta-asv-eng.asp" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Special Travel Authorities Policy">Special Travel Authorities Policy</a>&nbsp;states that where a contract specifies that “travel is in accordance with the Travel Directive,” it refers strictly to the negotiated meal, private vehicle and incidental allowances specified in appendices&nbsp;B, C and&nbsp;D, and to those policy provisions referring to “travelers” rather than those referring to “employees.” It is a department's responsibility to inform contractors (and those bidding on contracts) of the current government rates and allowances.</p>
										<p>In an effort to contain costs, the department will reimburse contractors for fares up to full-fare economy only. Contractors are required to seek the lowest possible airfares, including charters and other discounts for each trip, and to book immediately upon contract approval, in order to take advantage of the lowest fares. The employing department retains the right to limit the reimbursement of the air portion when the lowest appropriate fare is not obtained. Upgrades to business or first class may be personally paid by the contractor or private-sector company, where this is company policy.</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Yes and in this particular situation, both the solicitation and contract do need to include “Crown-owns” clauses addressing intellectual property rights. In this case, Public Safety has determined that any intellectual property arising from the performance of the work under the resulting contract will belong to Canada on the following grounds:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>The main purpose of the contract, or the deliverables contracted for, is to generate knowledge and information for public dissemination (Refer to&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-112" href="https://open.canada.ca/en" rel="external" target="_blank" title=" Open Government Portal">Appendix A, section 4.1</a>&nbsp;of the Policy on Title to Intellectual Property Arising Under Crown Procurement Contracts).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>The primary objective of Crown procurement contracts is to receive the deliverables contracted for, and to be able to use those deliverables, and any Intellectual Property (<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>) arising by the virtue of such contracts for Government of Canada activities. The Government of Canada's Contracting Policy further states that officials are to achieve best value for money and to seek the optimal balance of benefits to the Crown and the Canadian people through its purchases. As part&nbsp;of this commitment, the Government of Canada has made specific provisions for social and economic development objectives to be pursued through procurement.</p>
										<p>One of the socio-economic objectives pursued through Crown procurement contracts is the commercialization of intellectual property by the private sector to create jobs and generate economic growth. The&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-95" href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/068.nsf/eng/00005.html" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Content">Policy on Title to Intellectual Property Arising Under Crown Procurement Contracts</a>&nbsp;sets out a framework for the intellectual property arising by virtue of such contracts to be vested in the contractor, while ensuring the Crown's ability to use the deliverables contracted for and the intellectual property for all Government of Canada activities, including future contracts and procurements, and to protect the broader public interest.</p>
										<p>By default, the contractor is to own the Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>&nbsp;arising under Crown Procurement Contracts, unless the Crown claims one of the exceptions listed in the policy, or applies for a&nbsp;<abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>&nbsp;exemption from this policy through a&nbsp;<abbr title="Treasury Board">TB</abbr>&nbsp;Submission. Under Crown Procurement Contracts, the Crown may claim ownership of the Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>&nbsp;for any of the reasons listed in&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-112" href="https://open.canada.ca/en" rel="external" target="_blank" title=" Open Government Portal">Appendix&nbsp;A&nbsp;– Exceptions to Contractor Ownership and Treasury Board Exemption</a>.</p>
										<p>The Crown may take ownership of Intellectual Property in circumstances where it is justified but not provided for in one of the exceptions listed in&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-112" href="https://open.canada.ca/en" rel="external" target="_blank" title=" Open Government Portal">Appendix&nbsp;A&nbsp;– Exceptions to Contractor Ownership and Treasury Board Exemption</a>, and the Responsible Department has, in collaboration with the Contracting Department, sought and obtained Treasury Board approval for such an exemption. Prior to seeking an exemption, it is important to consider whether Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>&nbsp;ownership is necessary, or if a licence would suffice.</p>
										<p>Contractor ownership of Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>&nbsp;does not preclude the Crown from using the Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>, provided that the Crown obtains a royalty-free licence to have the right to use, or have used by a third party, the Foreground&nbsp;<abbr title="Intellectual Property">IP</abbr>&nbsp;owned by the Contractor. The Contractor shall be required to obtain from its subcontractors those ownership or licence rights that the Contractor agrees, in the Crown Procurement Contract, to provide to the Crown.</p>
										<p><a data-ext="ext-wb-113" href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/068.nsf/eng/00005.html#appB" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Appendix B – Licensing Intellectual Property">Appendix&nbsp;B&nbsp;– Licensing Intellectual Property</a>&nbsp;differentiates Contractor-Owned Intellectual Property and Crown-Owned Intellectual Property.</p>

									<p>Let’s assume that the bid solicitation process has been completed (Notice of Proposed Procurement posted on the Government Electronic Tendering Service), that the four bids received have been carefully evaluated, and that a contract has been awarded to the successful bidder…</p>
									<p>Mr.&nbsp;Demers, VP of CBA Consulting Inc. (unsuccessful bidder&nbsp;“A”) asks for a debriefing session as he would like to know why his firm was not awarded the contract. During the debriefing session, Mr.&nbsp;Demers becomes irate and tells you that he feels that he and his firm were treated unfairly during the bid evaluation process. He demands that the contract awarded to the successful bidder be cancelled and the bids re‑evaluated.</p>
									<p>You inform Mr.&nbsp;Demers that the process was conducted in an open, fair and transparent manner, and that the bids were evaluated by a team of experts from the department. You inform him that the awarding of the contract stands and that the bids will not be re‑evaluated. Mr.&nbsp;Demers storms out of the boardroom and promises to do something about this situation.</p>
									<p>Given that this procurement is covered by trade agreements, with whom should Mr.&nbsp;Demers file his complaint?</p>

										<p><strong>The answer is:&nbsp;</strong>Given the fact that this procurement is covered by trade agreements, Mr.&nbsp;Demers should file his complaint with the&nbsp;<a data-ext="ext-wb-96" href="http://www.citt.gc.ca/" rel="external" target="_blank" title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">Canadian International Trade Tribunal</a>&nbsp;(<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>).</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>&nbsp;is designated as the independent bid challenge authority on federal government procurement covered by the trade agreements. A potential supplier may file a complaint concerning a procurement action to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>&nbsp;on the grounds that any aspect of the procurement process relating to a requirement covered by these agreements is unfair or discriminatory.</p>
										<p>The&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>&nbsp;is authorized to receive complaints pertaining to any aspect of the procurement process up to and including contract award, and also to conduct inquiries and make determinations.</p>
										<p>Contracting officers must ensure that complete documentation and records dealing with the complaint, including a dated record of all communications with suppliers, are maintained in order to substantiate that the procurement process was carried out in accordance with the obligations of the trade agreements.</p>
										<p>Suppliers have a limited time within which they may file a complaint to the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>. Generally, this is ten working days from the date on which the basis of the complaint became known, or reasonably should have been known, to the potential supplier.</p>
										<p>In terms of remedies, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>&nbsp;may make recommendations to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Re‑evaluate bids</li>
											<li>Re‑issue a solicitation</li>
											<li>Terminate a contract</li>
											<li>Award compensation</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In addition, the&nbsp;<abbr title="Canadian International Trade Tribunal">CITT</abbr>&nbsp;may order a department or agency to postpone the awarding of a contract pending the investigation of a complaint.</p>
